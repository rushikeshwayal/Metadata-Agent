      "evaluation_response": "## Evaluation of `find_mean` Function\n\nThe `find_mean` function demonstrates a good understanding of Pandas and data manipulation. Let's evaluate it based on the provided criteria:\n\n**1. Correctness:** The function correctly calculates the mean of a numeric column in a Pandas DataFrame. It accurately handles `NaN` values using `skipna=True`.\n\n**2. Efficiency:** The function is efficient. It directly accesses the column using `df[column_name]` and uses the optimized Pandas `mean()` method, which is implemented in highly efficient C code.  The time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of rows in the column, which is optimal for this task. Space complexity is O(1) as it doesn't create large intermediate data structures.\n\n**3. Edge Case Handling:** The function excels in handling edge cases:\n    * It checks if the input is a DataFrame using `isinstance`.\n    * It verifies the column's existence using `column_name in df.columns`.\n    * It gracefully handles empty DataFrames.\n    * It correctly identifies non-numeric columns and returns `None`.\n\n**4. Readability & Maintainability:** The code is well-structured, easy to read, and well-commented.  Variable names are descriptive.\n\n**5. Scalability:** The function scales well with large datasets because it leverages Pandas' efficient vectorized operations.  The `mean()` method is highly optimized for large arrays.\n\n**6. Security & Robustness:**  No apparent security vulnerabilities. The input validation prevents common errors.\n\n**7. Generalizability:** The function is easily generalizable to different datasets.  It only requires a DataFrame and a column name.\n\n**8. Data Handling & Type Safety:** The function uses `pd.api.types.is_numeric_dtype` to ensure type safety and correctly handles numeric data.  It explicitly handles non-numeric columns.\n\n**9. Error Handling:** The function includes appropriate error handling using `TypeError` and `ValueError` exceptions for invalid inputs.\n\n**10. Output Consistency:** The function consistently returns either a numeric value (the mean) or `None`, maintaining output type consistency.\n\n\n**Domain-Specific Considerations:**\n\n* **Numerical Data:** The function is designed specifically for numerical data and handles it correctly, including `NaN` values.\n* **Categorical & Text Data:** The function correctly identifies and handles categorical or text data by returning `None`, as the mean is not applicable.\n* **Date & Time Data:** The function will return `None` for date and time columns because `is_numeric_dtype` will evaluate to `False`.  While it doesn't explicitly handle date/time data, its behavior is consistent and predictable.  To handle date/time data, a different function would be needed that performs appropriate calculations (e.g., average timestamp).\n* **Geographical Data:**  Similar to date/time data, the function correctly identifies geographical data as non-numeric and returns `None`.  Specialized functions would be necessary for geographical data analysis.\n\n\n**Final Score:**\n\n```json\n{\"score\": 9}\n```",

      "evaluation_response": "## Function Evaluation: `find_mean`\n\nHere's a detailed evaluation of the `find_mean` function based on the provided criteria:\n\n**1. Correctness:** The function correctly calculates the mean of a numeric column. It accurately handles cases where the column is empty or contains non-numeric values by converting them to NaN and checking if all values are NaN.\n\n**2. Efficiency:** The function is reasonably efficient.  Using pandas' built-in vectorized operations (`pd.to_numeric`, `.mean()`, `.isnull().all()`) avoids explicit looping, making it performant for most datasets.  The time complexity is dominated by `pd.to_numeric`, which is generally O(n), where n is the number of rows. Space complexity is O(n) as well due to creating a copy of the column.\n\n**3. Edge Case Handling:** The function excels in edge case handling:\n    * **Empty Column:**  It correctly returns `np.nan` for empty columns.\n    * **Non-numeric Data:** It uses `errors='coerce'` in `pd.to_numeric` to gracefully handle non-numeric values, converting them to NaN.\n    * **All Non-numeric Data:** It correctly returns `np.nan` if all values in the column are converted to NaN.\n    * **Missing Column:** It raises a `KeyError` if the specified column doesn't exist, providing informative error messaging.\n\n**4.

Scalability:** The function leverages pandas' optimized operations, making it reasonably scalable.  However, for extremely large datasets, memory usage could become a concern.  For truly massive datasets,  consider using Dask or other libraries designed for distributed computing.\n\n**6. Security & Robustness:** No apparent security vulnerabilities. The function safely handles potential errors and invalid inputs without crashing.\n\n**7. Generalizability:** The function is highly generalizable. It can be applied to various DataFrames and columns with minimal modification.\n\n**8. Data Handling & Type Safety:** The function explicitly handles data type conversions using `pd.to_numeric`, ensuring type safety and preventing unexpected errors from mixed data types.\n\n**9. Error Handling:** The function includes appropriate error handling with the `KeyError` exception for missing columns.  It could optionally include more specific error handling (e.g., a `TypeError` if the input `df` is not a DataFrame), but the current level is sufficient.\n\n**10.

This is consistent with the function's design.\n* **Date & Time Data:**  The function will also return `np.nan` for date and time columns unless the column contains numerical representations of dates/times that `pd.to_numeric` can interpret.  It doesn't explicitly handle date/time formats. For more sophisticated handling of dates/times, you would need to incorporate date/time parsing and manipulation functions.\n* **Geographical Data:** Similar to date/time data, the function will return `np.nan` for geographical data unless the data is already in a numeric format that `pd.to_numeric` can handle (like latitude and longitude coordinates).  Specialized geo-processing libraries would be needed for more complex geographical data analysis.\n\n\n**Final Score:**\n\n```json\n{\"score\": 9}\n```",

Data Handling & Type Safety:** The function demonstrates good data handling and type safety. It explicitly checks the input DataFrame type and uses `pd.to_numeric` for safe type conversion.\n\n**9. Error Handling:** The explicit `TypeError` and `KeyError` exceptions provide robust error handling.  The function doesn't rely on implicit error handling.\n\n**10. Output Consistency:** The function consistently returns a single numeric value (the mean) or `np.nan`, maintaining consistent output type and format.\n\n\n**Domain-Specific Considerations:**\n\n* **Numerical Data:** The function is designed for and correctly handles numerical data.\n\n* **Categorical & Text Data:**  The function is not appropriate for categorical or text data.  Attempting to use it will result in a `np.nan` return value (as `pd.to_numeric` coerces non-numeric values to NaN).\n\n* **Date & Time Data:**  Similar to categorical data, the function will return `np.nan` for datetime columns because `pd.to_numeric` will fail.  A different approach would be needed for meaningful analysis of date and time data (e.g., calculating the average date/time).\n\n* **Geographical Data:** This function is not suitable for geographical data.  Latitude and longitude, while numeric, usually require specialized analysis functions.\n\n\n**Final Score:**\n\n```json\n{\"score\": 9}\n```\n\nThe function is well-designed, efficient, robust, and highly scalable.  It exhibits excellent error handling and readability.  The only reason it doesn't receive a perfect 10 is that it doesn't explicitly handle date/time or geographical data (though its behavior is predictable and consistent in these cases by returning NaN).  Adding explicit checks and alternative handling for these data types would make it even better.",
      "score": 9,
      "optimize_prompt": "\n**Task:** Improve the following function based on the provided feedback.  \n\n#### **Feedback:**  \n## Function Evaluation: `find_mean`\n\nHere's a detailed evaluation of the `find_mean` function based on the provided criteria:\n\n**1. Correctness:** The function correctly calculates the mean of a numeric column in a Pandas DataFrame. It accurately handles cases where the column contains non-numeric values by converting them to NaN using `pd.to_numeric(errors='coerce')`.  It also correctly returns `np.nan` if the column is empty or contains only NaNs after cleaning.\n\n**2. Efficiency:** The function is reasonably efficient.  The use of Pandas vectorized operations (`pd.to_numeric`, `.mean()`) avoids explicit looping, making it suitable for moderately sized datasets.  For extremely large datasets, further optimization might be needed (e.g., using Dask for parallel processing).\n\n**3. Edge Case Handling:** The function demonstrates good edge case handling:\n    * It raises a `TypeError` if the input `df` is not a Pandas DataFrame.\n    * It raises a `KeyError` if the specified `column_name` doesn't exist.\n    * It handles non-numeric values gracefully by converting them to NaN.\n    * It correctly returns `np.nan` for empty or all-NaN columns.\n\n**4. Readability & Maintainability:** The code is well-structured and easy to understand.  Variable names are meaningful, and comments clearly explain the function's purpose and logic.  The use of `try-except` blocks improves error handling and makes the code more robust.\n\n**5. Scalability:** While the function uses vectorized operations, its scalability could be improved for extremely large datasets.  For very large DataFrames, using a more scalable library like Dask or Vaex might be necessary.\n\n**6. Security & Robustness:** The function doesn't have any apparent security vulnerabilities. It properly handles potential errors and avoids unexpected behaviors through its error handling mechanisms.\n\n**7. Generalizability:** The function is quite generalizable. It can be applied to various datasets with a numeric column without modification.\n\n**8. Data Handling & Type Safety:** The function effectively handles data types.  It explicitly checks the input DataFrame type and uses `pd.to_numeric` to safely convert the column to numeric, handling non-numeric values appropriately.\n\n**9. Error Handling:**  The `try-except` block effectively catches potential `ValueError` and `TypeError` exceptions during numeric conversion.  The raising of `TypeError` and `KeyError` also enhances robustness.\n\n**10. Output Consistency:** The function consistently returns a single numeric value (the mean) or `np.nan` if the column is not numeric or contains only NaNs after cleaning.  The output type is consistent.\n\n\n**Domain-Specific Considerations:**\n\n* **Numerical Data:** The function is specifically designed for numerical data and handles it correctly.\n\n* **Categorical & Text Data:** The function is *not* suitable for categorical or text data.  Attempting to calculate the mean of such data would be meaningless and would likely result in `np.nan` being returned (after the `pd.to_numeric` conversion fails).\n\n* **Date & Time Data:** The function is not designed for date and time data.  Directly applying `.mean()` to datetime objects would give a numerical result representing the average timestamp (which might not be meaningful).  The function would return `np.nan` if the column is a datetime column since `pd.to_numeric` will fail to convert datetime objects.\n\n* **Geographical Data:** The function is not suitable for geographical data.  Latitude and longitude could be treated as numerical, but calculating the mean of these values across a dataset would usually not be a meaningful operation.  More specialized functions would be required for geographic analysis.\n\n\n**Final Score:**\n\n```json\n{\"score\": 8}\n```\n\nThe function is well-implemented, robust, and handles edge cases effectively.  Its main limitations are a lack of explicit handling of date/time and categorical data (though it handles them gracefully by returning NaN), and potential scalability issues with extremely large datasets.  Minor improvements could boost the score to a 9.  \n\n#### **Function:**  \n```python  \n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_mean(df, column_name):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the mean of a specified column in a DataFrame if the column is numeric.\n\n    Args:\n        df: The input pandas DataFrame.\n        column_name: The name of the column to calculate the mean from.\n\n    Returns:\n        The mean of the specified column if it's numeric, otherwise None.

      "evaluation_response": "## Evaluation of `is_duration` Function\n\nThe `is_duration` function aims to check if a DataFrame column is numeric and, if so, calculate its mean. Let's evaluate it based on the provided criteria:\n\n**1. Correctness:** The function correctly identifies numeric columns and computes the mean.  It accurately handles cases where the column is not numeric by returning `None`.\n\n**2. Efficiency:** The function is reasonably efficient. Using `pd.to_numeric` with `errors='raise'` is a good approach for efficient numeric conversion and error handling.  The use of NumPy's `np.mean` for mean calculation is also efficient.  Time complexity is largely determined by `pd.to_numeric`, which is generally efficient for most datasets. Space complexity is minimal as it primarily uses the column's data.\n\n**3. Edge Case Handling:** The function effectively handles several edge cases:\n    * **Non-DataFrame input:** It checks the input type and returns `None` with an error message if it's not a DataFrame.\n    * **Missing column:** It checks if the specified column exists and returns `None` with an error message if it doesn't.\n    * **Non-numeric data:** It uses `pd.to_numeric` with `errors='raise'` which will throw an error if the conversion isn't possible, this is caught and handled gracefully.\n    * **Errors during conversion:** The `try-except` block catches `ValueError` and `TypeError` during the numeric conversion and returns `None` with a descriptive message.  It also has a catch-all `except` for unforeseen errors.\n\n**4. Readability & Maintainability:** The code is well-structured and easy to understand.  Variable names are meaningful, and comments explain the function's purpose and logic clearly.\n\n**5. Scalability:** The function should scale well to large datasets because it operates directly on pandas Series and NumPy arrays, which are optimized for numerical computation.  The underlying pandas and NumPy libraries are efficient in handling large datasets.\n\n**6. Security & Robustness:** There are no apparent security vulnerabilities. The function validates inputs and handles errors effectively, preventing unexpected crashes or behaviors.\n\n**7. Generalizability:** The function is quite generalizable. It can be applied to various DataFrames and columns with minimal modification.\n\n**8. Data Handling & Type Safety:** The function explicitly checks the data type of the input DataFrame and uses `pd.to_numeric` for type conversion, ensuring type safety.  The `errors='raise'` argument in `pd.to_numeric` enhances type safety by raising an exception if conversion fails.\n\n**9. Error Handling:** The function employs comprehensive error handling using `try-except` blocks to catch and handle potential errors gracefully, providing informative error messages.\n\n**10. Output Consistency:** The function consistently returns either a numerical value (the mean) or `None`.  The output type is consistent.\n\n\n**Domain-Specific Considerations:**\n\n* **Numerical Data:** The function excels at handling numerical data.  It's specifically designed for this purpose.\n\n* **Categorical & Text Data:** The function will correctly identify categorical and text columns as non-numeric and return `None`, as expected.\n\n* **Date & Time Data:** The function will not correctly handle date and time data directly.  `pd.to_numeric` will fail on such columns, causing the function to return `None`. To handle date/time data, you would need to either pre-process it to convert it to numerical representation (e.g., Unix timestamps) or create a separate function tailored for date/time calculations.\n\n* **Geographical Data:** Similar to date/time data, geographical data (latitude, longitude, etc.) would need preprocessing or a separate function to handle them appropriately.\n\n\n**Final Score:**\n\n```json\n{\"score\": 9}\n```\n\nThe function is well-written, efficient, robust, and handles most edge cases effectively.

Let's evaluate it based on the provided criteria:\n\n**1. Correctness:** The function correctly identifies numeric columns and computes the mean of numeric data, excluding NaN values. It returns `None` when the input is not a DataFrame or the specified column is not found or is not numeric, which is the expected behavior.\n\n**2. Efficiency:** The function's efficiency is good. It uses vectorized pandas operations (`dropna()`, `np.mean()`) which are generally optimized. The time complexity is dominated by the `dropna()` and `np.mean()` operations, which are typically O(n), where n is the number of rows. Space complexity is relatively low, mainly determined by the size of the DataFrame.\n\n**3. Edge Case Handling:** The function excels in edge case handling. It explicitly checks for:\n    * Non-DataFrame input.\n    * Non-existent column.\n    * Non-numeric columns.\n    * Columns containing only NaN values.  These checks prevent errors and provide informative error messages.\n\n**4. Readability & Maintainability:** The code is well-structured and easy to understand.  Variable names are descriptive, and comments clearly explain the function's purpose and logic.\n\n**5. Scalability:** The function should scale well to large datasets because of pandas' efficient vectorized operations. However,  for extremely large datasets, memory usage could become a concern.  Chunking the data might be necessary in such scenarios (though not implemented here).\n\n**6. Security & Robustness:** There are no apparent security vulnerabilities.  The function does not interact with external resources or user-supplied code that could introduce risks.\n\n**7. Generalizability:** The function is quite generalizable. It can be applied to various DataFrames and column names without modification.\n\n\n**8. Data Handling & Type Safety:** The function uses `pd.api.types.is_numeric_dtype` for reliable type checking, which handles various numeric types correctly.  It explicitly handles NaN values, preventing errors.\n\n**9. Error Handling:** The function uses `if` statements to check for errors and returns `None` along with informative error messages printed to the console, preventing unexpected crashes.  While it uses `print` statements for error handling, a more sophisticated approach might involve raising exceptions for better error management in a larger application.\n\n**10. Output Consistency:** The function consistently returns either a numerical mean (a scalar value) or `None`. The output type is consistent.\n\n\n**Domain-Specific Considerations:**\n\n* **Numerical Data:** The function handles numerical data perfectly, calculating the mean correctly and handling NaN values appropriately.\n* **Categorical & Text Data:**  The function correctly identifies and handles non-numeric columns by returning `None`. It doesn't attempt to compute a mean for non-numeric data, which is appropriate.\n* **Date & Time Data:** The function will treat datetime columns as *non-numeric* and return `None`.  This is technically correct based on the `is_numeric_dtype` check, but it might be desirable to add optional handling for datetime columns (e.g., converting to a numerical representation like Unix timestamps before calculating the mean).\n* **Geographical Data:** The function does not specifically handle geographical data.  It treats latitude/longitude or other geographical fields as non-numeric, returning `None`.  Adding specialized handling for geographical data would require substantial modifications.\n\n\n**Final Score:**\n\nConsidering all aspects, the function is well-implemented and robust. The minor improvements suggested (exception handling instead of `print` for errors, potential datetime handling) are relatively small.\n\n```json\n{\"score\": 9}\n```",

      "evaluation_response": "## Evaluation of the `is_time` Function (Version 3)\n\nThis version of the `is_time` function incorporates logging and a customizable format string, addressing some of the previous feedback. Let's evaluate it:\n\n**1. Correctness:** The function's correctness is improved.  The addition of the `format_string` parameter allows for more precise control over time format parsing, increasing its accuracy for various time representations.  However,  it's still reliant on `pd.to_datetime`, which might not handle all edge cases perfectly.  A completely exhaustive solution would require a more complex, custom parsing routine.\n\n**2. Efficiency:**  The function remains efficient. The use of vectorized operations in `pd.to_datetime` ensures good performance even with large datasets. Time and space complexity are still favorable.\n\n**3. Edge Case Handling:** The function effectively handles missing columns, empty columns, and incorrect data types. The `errors='coerce'` parameter and the `try-except` block effectively manage errors during parsing.  The logging of errors provides valuable debugging information.\n\n**4. Readability & Maintainability:** The code is highly readable and well-maintained. The comments are clear, and the addition of the `format_string` parameter improves flexibility without sacrificing readability.  The use of logging is a good practice for error management.\n\n**5. Scalability:** The function scales well due to its vectorized nature and avoids explicit loops.  Its performance characteristics are suitable for large datasets.\n\n**6. Security & Robustness:**  No security vulnerabilities are present. The function is robust due to its error handling and type checking mechanisms.\n\n**7. Generalizability:** The addition of the `format_string` parameter significantly enhances generalizability.  Users can adapt the function to various time formats by providing the appropriate format string. This makes it much more versatile.\n\n**8. Data Handling & Type Safety:** The function correctly validates the data type of the input column, ensuring that it's a string type before attempting parsing. This prevents errors and improves type safety.\n\n**9. Error Handling:** The error handling is excellent. The `try-except` block catches exceptions, and the logging mechanism provides detailed information about parsing errors. This is crucial for debugging and understanding data quality issues.\n\n**10. Output Consistency:**  The function consistently returns a Pandas Series of boolean values, ensuring consistent output.\n\n\n**Domain-Specific Considerations:**\n\n* **Numerical Data:**  Handles numerical columns appropriately by returning all `False`.\n* **Categorical & Text Data:** Works correctly with categorical columns containing string representations of times.\n* **Date & Time Data:**  Focuses on time; if a column contains full datetimes, it only assesses the time portion.\n* **Geographical Data:** Not applicable.\n\n\n**Final Score:**\n\nThis version of the function is well-designed, efficient, robust, and highly generalizable. The addition of the `format_string` parameter and the improved logging makes it a significant improvement over previous versions.  It addresses almost all previous feedback points effectively.\n\n```json\n{\"score\": 9}\n```",

      "optimize_prompt": "\n**Task:** Improve the following function based on the provided feedback.  \n\n#### **Feedback:**  \n## Evaluation of the Improved `is_time` Function\n\nThe revised `is_time` function shows significant improvement over the original version. Let's evaluate it based on the provided criteria:\n\n**1. Correctness:** The function is more correct than the previous version. The use of `infer_datetime_format=True` in `pd.to_datetime` allows it to handle a wider range of time formats automatically, improving its accuracy. However, it still might not catch *all* possible valid time formats, especially less common or unusual ones.\n\n**2. Efficiency:** The use of a single `pd.to_datetime` call with vectorization is a substantial improvement over the original's `apply()` method. This makes it significantly more efficient for large datasets.  The time complexity is now largely determined by the underlying `pd.to_datetime` implementation, which is generally optimized. Space complexity remains relatively low as it primarily uses the existing DataFrame column.\n\n**3. Edge Case Handling:** The function now explicitly checks for the string data type before attempting time parsing. This prevents errors from numerical or other data types. The `errors='coerce'` argument within `pd.to_datetime` effectively handles invalid time strings, and the `try-except` block catches potential `ValueError` and `TypeError` exceptions, making it more robust against unexpected inputs.  Missing and empty columns are still handled correctly.\n\n**4. Readability & Maintainability:** The code is well-structured and readable.  Variable names are clear, and the comments effectively explain the function's logic. The separation of type checking and time parsing enhances maintainability.\n\n**5. Scalability:** The vectorized approach using `pd.to_datetime` makes the function highly scalable. It avoids the performance bottleneck of the previous `apply()` method, allowing it to handle large datasets efficiently.\n\n**6. Security & Robustness:**  No security vulnerabilities are apparent. The error handling and type checking significantly enhance the robustness of the function.\n\n**7. Generalizability:** The function is more generalizable than before thanks to `infer_datetime_format=True`.  However, adding a parameter to allow users to specify custom format strings would further improve its flexibility.\n\n**8. Data Handling & Type Safety:** The explicit check for string data type (`pd.api.types.is_string_dtype`) significantly improves data type safety.  This prevents unexpected behavior when the input column is not of the expected type.\n\n**9. Error Handling:** The `try-except` block is a good addition.  While it catches major errors, consider adding more specific error handling (e.g., logging the problematic values) to aid in debugging and identifying data quality issues.\n\n**10. Output Consistency:** The function consistently returns a Pandas Series of boolean values, maintaining consistent output.\n\n\n**Domain-Specific Considerations:**\n\n* **Numerical Data:** The function correctly handles numerical columns by returning a series of `False` values, indicating that they are not valid times.\n* **Categorical & Text Data:** The function primarily works with text data. Categorical columns containing string representations of times will be correctly evaluated; others will return `False`.\n* **Date & Time Data:** The function focuses on time components.  If the column contains full datetimes, only the time part is considered.  The `infer_datetime_format` helps with various time formats, but a more robust solution might be needed for complex scenarios with date and time combined.\n* **Geographical Data:**  The function is not designed for geographical data and would not be suitable for processing such data.\n\n\n\n**Final Score:**\n\nThe improved function demonstrates substantial improvements in efficiency, scalability, and robustness. The addition of type checking and more comprehensive error handling makes it considerably more reliable.  While it could benefit from additional flexibility (allowing user-specified formats) and more detailed error logging, it's a significant improvement.\n\n```json\n{\"score\": 8}\n```  \n\n#### **Function:**  \n```python  \n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef is_time(df, column_name):\n    \"\"\"\n    Efficiently verifies if a given DataFrame column contains valid time values.\n\n    Args:\n        df: The Pandas DataFrame.\n        column_name: The name of the column to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        A Pandas Series of boolean values indicating whether each value \n        in the specified column is a valid time.

      "evaluation_response": "## Evaluation of the `is_time` Function (Version 3)\n\nThis version improves upon the previous iterations by adding a `try-except` block to handle potential `TypeError` and `ValueError` exceptions during the `astype(str)` conversion.\n\n**1. Correctness:** The function correctly identifies valid HH:MM and HH:MM:SS time formats based on the regular expression. It accurately returns `False` for values that do not match the pattern.\n\n**2. Efficiency:**  The function remains efficient. The use of vectorized operations (`str.match`) keeps the time complexity low, even for large DataFrames.\n\n**3. Edge Case Handling:**  The function handles missing columns and empty columns correctly.  The `try-except` block effectively handles cases where `astype(str)` might fail due to incompatible data types in the column.  It gracefully returns `False` for all elements if the conversion fails.  It also correctly handles `NaN` values, converting them to strings and then evaluating them against the regex.\n\n**4. Readability & Maintainability:** The code is well-structured, readable, and maintainable.  The regular expression is clearly defined and commented. Variable names are meaningful.\n\n**5. Scalability:** The vectorized nature of the pandas operations ensures excellent scalability.  Performance degradation should be minimal even with very large datasets.\n\n**6. Security & Robustness:** No security vulnerabilities are apparent. The function is robust against various data types and potential errors. The `try-except` block prevents unexpected crashes.\n\n**7. Generalizability:** The function is reasonably generalizable within the limits of the regular expression.  Adding support for AM/PM or other time formats would require modifying the regular expression.\n\n**8. Data Handling & Type Safety:** The function handles pandas Series effectively. The `try-except` block improves type safety by catching exceptions that might arise from attempting to convert non-string values to strings.  However, it still doesn't explicitly check data types before the conversion; it relies on the exception handling to deal with errors.\n\n**9. Error Handling:** The `try-except` block is a significant improvement, providing explicit error handling.  This prevents crashes and provides a consistent `False` return for problematic data.\n\n**10. Output Consistency:** The function consistently returns a Pandas Series of boolean values, maintaining output consistency.\n\n\n**Domain-Specific Considerations:**\n\n* **Numerical Data:**  The function will treat numerical data as strings and attempt to match the time pattern. Numbers that happen to look like times (e.g., \"10:30\") will be marked as valid; others will be marked as invalid. This behavior is consistent but might not be ideal depending on the use case.\n\n* **Categorical & Text Data:** Categorical and text data are handled correctly.  The function will evaluate each category/text value against the time pattern.\n\n* **Date & Time Data:** The function only handles the time component.  If a column contains date and time strings, it will only validate the time portion according to its pattern.  Date information is ignored.\n\n\n**Improvements:**\n\n* **More Flexible Time Format:** Extend the regular expression to handle a wider range of time formats (e.g., AM/PM, time zones).\n\n* **Explicit Type Validation:** Add a check before `astype(str)` to see if the column is of a numeric type.  If it is numeric, you could choose to either raise an error or return a series of `False` values.  This would increase the robustness and provide more informative feedback.\n\n* **Docstring Enhancement:**  The docstring could be improved by explicitly stating the limitations of the current implementation (e.g., only supports HH:MM and HH:MM:SS formats; does not handle AM/PM, time zones).\n\n\n\n**Final Score:**\n\n```json\n{\"score\": 9}\n```\n\nThis version is well-implemented, efficient, robust, and scalable.  The addition of the `try-except` block significantly improves its handling of edge cases. The minor suggested improvements would further enhance its flexibility and clarity.",
      "score": 9,
      "optimize_prompt": "\n**Task:** Improve the following function based on the provided feedback.  \n\n#### **Feedback:**  \n## Evaluation of the Improved `is_time` Function\n\nThe revised `is_time` function uses regular expressions for time validation, addressing a key weakness of the previous version. Let's evaluate it:\n\n**1. Correctness:** The function is more correct than the previous version because it uses a regular expression to validate a wider range of time formats (HH:MM, HH:MM:SS).  It correctly identifies valid and invalid times according to the specified pattern. However, it doesn't handle times outside the 24-hour clock format or other variations (e.g., AM/PM).\n\n**2. Efficiency:** The function is efficient. Using pandas' vectorized `.str.match()` is significantly faster than iterating through the series, especially for large datasets. The regular expression itself is relatively simple and should not be a performance bottleneck.\n\n**3. Edge Case Handling:** The function handles missing columns and empty columns correctly. It also implicitly handles non-string data types by converting them to strings via `.astype(str)`. The `.fillna(False)` handles cases where `str.match` returns `NaN` (for example, if a cell is empty or contains `None`).\n\n**4. Readability & Maintainability:** The code is very readable and maintainable. The regular expression is clearly defined and commented. Variable names are descriptive. The logic is straightforward.\n\n**5. Scalability:**  The use of vectorized pandas operations ensures excellent scalability. The function should perform well even on very large datasets.\n\n**6. Security & Robustness:**  No security vulnerabilities are apparent. The function operates only on the provided data and doesn't interact with external sources.  It's robust in handling various input types.\n\n**7. Generalizability:** The function is more generalizable than the original due to the use of the regular expression.  However, it's still limited to the specific time format defined by the regular expression.  Extending it to accommodate other formats would require modifying the regular expression.\n\n**8. Data Handling & Type Safety:** The function handles pandas Series effectively. The `astype(str)` conversion handles various data types gracefully, although it might mask underlying type errors (e.g., if a cell contains a non-string, non-numeric value that can't be converted to a string).  More explicit type checking could be added for more robustness.\n\n**9. Error Handling:** Error handling is implicit through the use of `.fillna(False)`.  While this is generally sufficient, explicit error handling (e.g., using `try-except` for cases where `astype(str)` might fail) would make it even more robust.\n\n**10. Output Consistency:** The function consistently returns a Pandas Series of boolean values, fulfilling the requirements.\n\n\n**Domain-Specific Considerations:**\n\n* **Numerical Data:** The function is not designed for numerical data. Applying it to a numerical column will result in a series of booleans, but these booleans will mostly be `False` unless the numbers happen to coincidentally match the time format.\n\n* **Categorical & Text Data:** The function can handle categorical data if the categories represent times in the specified format.  Non-matching categories will result in `False`.\n\n* **Date & Time Data:** The function focuses on *time* data, not date data. It correctly handles time portions within a broader date/time string *only if* those time portions conform to the defined regex.\n\n\n**Improvements:**\n\n* **More Comprehensive Regex:** Consider expanding the regular expression to handle a broader set of time formats, including AM/PM and perhaps timezone information, if needed.\n\n* **Explicit Type Handling:** Add more explicit error handling (e.g., `try-except` blocks) to deal with potential issues during the `astype(str)` conversion.\n\n* **Documentation:** While the docstring is good, adding details about the specific time format the regex supports would improve clarity.\n\n\n**Final Score:**\n\n```json\n{\"score\": 8}\n```\n\nThe improved function is a significant step up from the original. The use of regular expressions makes it more flexible and robust.  The minor improvements suggested above would make it even better.  \n\n#### **Function:**  \n```python  \n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport re\n\ndef is_time(df, column_name):\n    \"\"\"\n    Verifies if a given column in a Pandas DataFrame contains valid time values.

      "evaluation_response": "## Evaluation of the `is_date` function\n\nHere's a detailed evaluation of the provided Python function based on the specified criteria:\n\n**1. Correctness:** The function correctly identifies whether a Pandas DataFrame column can be converted to datetime format using `pd.to_datetime`. It returns `True` only if *all* values in the column are successfully converted; otherwise, it returns `False`.  The `errors='raise'` argument ensures that any invalid date format will trigger an exception, preventing incorrect results.\n\n**2. Efficiency:** The function's efficiency is good. It uses Pandas' vectorized operations (`pd.to_datetime`), which are significantly faster than iterating through each element individually. The time complexity is largely determined by `pd.to_datetime`, which is generally efficient for reasonably sized DataFrames. Space complexity is minimal as it only uses a few variables.\n\n**3. Edge Case Handling:** The function handles the following edge cases effectively:\n\n* **Missing Data:** `pd.to_datetime` handles `NaN` values gracefully; they don't cause the function to fail.\n* **Invalid Dates:** The `errors='raise'` argument correctly catches and handles any values that cannot be parsed as dates.\n* **Non-existent Column:** The initial check (`column_name not in df.columns`) prevents errors if the specified column doesn't exist.\n* **Empty Column:** An empty column will also be handled correctly, resulting in a `True` return as there are no invalid dates to cause an error.\n\n\n**4. Readability & Maintainability:** The code is well-structured and easy to understand.  Variable names are clear (`df`, `column_name`), and the docstring adequately explains the function's purpose, arguments, and return value.  The use of a `try-except` block improves error handling and readability.\n\n**5. Scalability:** The function leverages Pandas' vectorized operations, making it reasonably scalable.  For extremely large datasets, performance might become a concern, but for most typical datasets, it should be efficient.\n\n**6. Security & Robustness:** The function doesn't have any apparent security vulnerabilities. It's robust because of its error handling and explicit checks for column existence.\n\n**7. Generalizability:** The function is highly generalizable. It can be applied to any Pandas DataFrame and any column containing potential date information.\n\n**8. Data Handling & Type Safety:** The function explicitly handles data type issues through the `try-except` block and the use of `pd.to_datetime`. It correctly identifies if a column can be converted to datetime objects.\n\n**9. Error Handling:** The `try-except` block effectively catches `ValueError` and `TypeError` exceptions that can arise from invalid date formats or incorrect data types.\n\n**10. Output Consistency:** The function consistently returns a boolean value (`True` or `False`), providing clear and unambiguous results.\n\n\n**Domain-Specific Considerations:**\n\n* **Numerical Data:** The function is *not* designed for numerical data.  Attempting to use it on a numerical column will likely result in a `ValueError` because numbers cannot be directly converted to datetime objects without additional context (e.g., representing a Unix timestamp).\n\n* **Categorical & Text Data:** The function is *not* designed for categorical or text data unless those columns contain string representations of dates that `pd.to_datetime` can parse.  It will return `False` if the column contains non-date strings.\n\n* **Date & Time Data:** The function is designed for date and time data, handling various date formats (provided they are parsable by `pd.to_datetime`). It doesn't explicitly distinguish between Date, Time, Timezone, or Datetime columns; it treats them uniformly as long as they can be converted to datetime objects.\n\n* **Geographical Data:** The function is not suitable for geographical data.\n\n\n**Final Score:**\n\n```json\n{\"score\": 9}\n```\n\nThe function is well-written, efficient, and robust in its handling of date data.  Its main limitation is its lack of explicit handling of different data types beyond date-like strings.  A small extension to check the data type before attempting conversion would make it even more robust.",

Let's evaluate it based on the provided criteria:\n\n**1. Correctness:** The function correctly identifies datetime columns, handles various formats (with the optional `format` parameter), and accurately determines if a column contains only valid datetime objects or NaNs.  It correctly returns `False` for numeric and other non-datetime columns.\n\n**2. Efficiency:** The function is efficient. It uses vectorized operations (`pd.to_datetime`) and avoids unnecessary computations by checking the data type (`series.dtype`) before attempting conversion. The early exit for non-object types prevents unnecessary processing.\n\n**3. Edge Case Handling:** The function effectively handles:\n    * **Missing data (NaNs):** `errors='coerce'` in `pd.to_datetime` handles missing values gracefully.\n    * **Invalid datetime strings:**  `errors='coerce'` converts invalid strings to NaT, which are correctly handled.\n    * **Different datetime formats:** The optional `format` parameter allows specifying the format, improving robustness.\n    * **Non-existent columns:** The function checks if the column exists before proceeding.\n    * **Numeric and other data types:** The function explicitly handles numeric and other non-object dtypes, preventing errors and returning `False` appropriately.\n\n**4. Readability & Maintainability:** The code is well-structured, with clear variable names and comments. The logic is easy to follow. The docstring is informative and includes an example of usage.\n\n**5. Scalability:** The use of vectorized pandas operations makes the function scalable to large datasets.  The early checks based on dtype prevent unnecessary processing of large non-object columns.\n\n**6. Security & Robustness:** No security vulnerabilities are apparent. The function is robust due to its comprehensive error handling.\n\n**7. Generalizability:** The function is highly generalizable. It can be applied to various datasets and use cases with minimal modification. The optional `format` parameter makes it flexible.\n\n**8. Data Handling & Type Safety:** The function correctly validates data types using `series.dtype` and `pd.api.types` functions. It handles different data types appropriately. The `try-except` block prevents unexpected crashes.\n\n**9.

      "optimize_prompt": "\n**Task:** Improve the following function based on the provided feedback.  \n\n#### **Feedback:**  \n## Evaluation of `is_datetime` function\n\nThe `is_datetime` function demonstrates a good understanding of pandas and datetime handling, but has room for improvement in terms of explicitness and robustness.\n\n**1. Correctness:** The function correctly identifies whether a column contains only valid datetime objects or NaNs.  The use of `pd.to_datetime(errors='coerce')` is efficient and effective for handling invalid datetime strings.\n\n**2. Efficiency:** The function is reasonably efficient.  The use of vectorized operations in pandas (like `pd.to_datetime` and `isnull().all()`) avoids explicit looping, making it suitable for moderately sized datasets.  For extremely large datasets, further optimization might be needed, potentially involving chunking the DataFrame.\n\n**3. Edge Case Handling:** The function handles missing data (NaNs) correctly. It also gracefully handles cases where the specified column doesn't exist.  It effectively catches `ValueError` and `TypeError` exceptions that might arise from malformed data. However, it doesn't explicitly handle different datetime formats, relying on pandas' default inference.  Explicit format specification could improve robustness.\n\n**4. Readability & Maintainability:** The code is well-structured and reasonably well-commented. Variable names are clear. The logic is straightforward.  Adding a docstring example would enhance readability.\n\n**5. Scalability:**  While the vectorized operations make it relatively scalable, performance might degrade with extremely large datasets.  Chunking the data for processing could mitigate this.\n\n**6. Security & Robustness:** No obvious security vulnerabilities are present. The function is robust in handling common errors.\n\n**7. Generalizability:** The function is quite generalizable. It can be easily applied to various datasets with minimal modification.\n\n**8. Data Handling & Type Safety:** The function correctly handles pandas Series.  It implicitly handles various datetime formats that pandas can infer.  More explicit format handling would improve type safety.\n\n**9. Error Handling:** The `try-except` block effectively catches potential errors during datetime conversion.\n\n**10. Output Consistency:** The function consistently returns a boolean value (True or False) as specified.\n\n\n**Domain-Specific Considerations:**\n\n* **Numerical Data:** The function is *not* designed for numerical data.  Attempting to use it on a numerical column will result in a `ValueError` which is correctly caught and returns `False`, but this isn't explicitly documented.\n\n* **Categorical & Text Data:** The function is *not* designed for categorical or text data.  Applying it to such columns will likely lead to a `ValueError` (correctly handled).\n\n* **Date & Time Data:** The function is designed for date and time data. However, it relies on pandas' automatic inference of datetime formats.  Adding an optional `format` parameter to specify the datetime format would significantly improve its ability to handle various date and time representations (e.g.,  `YYYY-MM-DD`, `MM/DD/YYYY`, etc.).\n\n* **Geographical Data:** The function is not applicable to geographical data.\n\n\n**Overall Score:**\n\nThe function is well-written and performs its intended task effectively.

      "evaluation_response": "## Evaluation of `is_datetime` Function (Improved Version)\n\nThis improved version addresses many of the shortcomings of the previous iteration.\n\n**1. Correctness:** The function is largely correct. It accurately identifies columns containing only valid datetime values or NaNs. The use of `np.allclose` with `equal_nan=True` is a significant improvement, correctly handling the potential for `pd.to_datetime` to return a `float64` dtype when dealing with NaT values.  However, it might still have subtle issues with certain edge cases involving mixed data types or very unusual datetime formats that `pd.to_datetime` might not parse consistently.\n\n**2. Efficiency:** The function is efficient.  Using `pd.to_datetime` with vectorized operations remains efficient. The use of `np.allclose` is a relatively fast comparison, especially compared to iterating through the series.  Space complexity remains minimal.\n\n**3. Edge Case Handling:** The function handles missing data (NaNs) and empty columns exceptionally well. It checks for column existence and emptiness explicitly.  The `try-except` block catches `ValueError` and `TypeError`, preventing crashes.  However,  the handling of extremely unusual or malformed datetime strings could still be improved (though this pushes the boundaries of what's reasonably expected).\n\n**4. Readability & Maintainability:** The code is well-structured, readable, and maintainable.  Variable names are descriptive, and comments explain the logic clearly.\n\n**5. Scalability:** The function scales well to large datasets due to the use of vectorized operations in Pandas and NumPy.  The memory usage is significantly improved compared to element-wise comparisons.\n\n**6. Security & Robustness:** No security vulnerabilities are apparent. Input handling is robust, and error handling prevents crashes.\n\n**7. Generalizability:** The function is highly generalizable and can be applied to various datasets and use cases.\n\n**8. Data Handling & Type Safety:** Data types are handled effectively. The function implicitly handles mixed types within a column by leveraging `pd.to_datetime`'s coercion.\n\n**9. Error Handling:** The `try-except` block is effective and prevents crashes due to unexpected input.\n\n**10. Output Consistency:** The function consistently returns a boolean value.\n\n\n**Domain-Specific Considerations:**\n\n* **Numerical Data:**  The function will correctly return `False` for numerical columns because `pd.to_datetime` will fail to convert numerical values.\n\n* **Categorical & Text Data:**  Similar to numerical data, it will correctly return `False` for categorical columns unless those columns happen to contain strings that are parsable as dates/times by `pd.to_datetime`.\n\n* **Date & Time Data:** The function is designed for date and time data and handles various formats well, thanks to the `pd.to_datetime` function. The improved `np.allclose` comparison handles NaT values more robustly.\n\n* **Geographical Data:** The function remains unsuitable for geographical data.\n\n\n**Final Score:**\n\n{\"score\": 9}\n\nThe function is very well implemented, efficient, and robust. The minor deduction is due to the potential for very subtle edge cases involving extremely unusual or malformed datetime strings that might not be handled perfectly, although this is a relatively small concern in most practical applications.",

      "optimize_prompt": "\n**Task:** Improve the following function based on the provided feedback.  \n\n#### **Feedback:**  \n## Evaluation of `is_datetime` Function\n\nThe `is_datetime` function demonstrates a good understanding of Pandas and datetime handling but has room for improvement.\n\n**1. Correctness:** The function correctly identifies whether a column contains only valid datetime values or NaNs.  It accurately handles cases where the entire column is NaN. The `errors='coerce'` argument in `pd.to_datetime` is crucial for robust handling of invalid datetime strings.\n\n**2. Efficiency:** The function is reasonably efficient. Using `pd.to_datetime` with `errors='coerce'` is an optimized approach, avoiding individual value checks. The time complexity is largely determined by Pandas' internal implementation of `to_datetime`, which is generally efficient for most datasets. Space complexity is minimal, as it primarily uses the existing DataFrame column.\n\n**3. Edge Case Handling:** The function handles missing data (NaNs) well. It explicitly checks for the column's existence before proceeding.  It also gracefully handles `ValueError` and `TypeError` exceptions that might arise from unexpected data types in the column.\n\n**4. Readability & Maintainability:** The code is well-structured and readable.  Variable names are meaningful, and comments explain the logic clearly.\n\n**5. Scalability:** The function should scale reasonably well to large datasets because of the efficiency of Pandas' vectorized operations. However, for extremely large datasets, memory usage might become a concern if the column contains many invalid datetime strings that need to be coerced to NaN.\n\n**6. Security & Robustness:** No apparent security vulnerabilities. Input handling is appropriate, and error handling prevents crashes.\n\n**7. Generalizability:** The function is highly generalizable. It can be used with any Pandas DataFrame and column containing potential datetime data.\n\n**8. Data Handling & Type Safety:** The function correctly handles various data types within the column. Non-datetime values are coerced to NaN, allowing for a clear determination of validity.\n\n**9. Error Handling:** The `try-except` block effectively catches potential errors during datetime conversion.\n\n**10. Output Consistency:** The function consistently returns a boolean value (True or False), ensuring consistent output.\n\n\n**Domain-Specific Considerations:**\n\n* **Numerical Data:** The function is *not* designed for numerical data.  Applying it to a numerical column would likely result in a `ValueError` during the `pd.to_datetime` conversion, correctly returning `False`.\n\n* **Categorical & Text Data:** The function is *not* designed for categorical or text data (unless the text data represents datetimes in a parsable format). Applying it to such columns would likely lead to `False` due to the conversion errors.\n\n* **Date & Time Data:** The function is designed for date and time data. It correctly handles various formats as long as they are convertible by `pd.to_datetime`.  It doesn't specifically distinguish between Date, Time, Timezone, or Datetime columns; it treats them all as potential datetime data.  If a column contains a mix of date and time formats, it will return `False` unless all entries are convertible to a consistent datetime representation.\n\n* **Geographical Data:** The function is not designed for geographical data.  It cannot interpret latitude, longitude, or addresses as datetime values.\n\n\n**Final Score:**\n\n{\"score\": 8}  \n\n#### **Function:**  \n```python  \n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef is_datetime(df, column_name):\n    \"\"\"\n    Validates if a DataFrame column contains valid datetime values.\n\n    Args:\n        df: The pandas DataFrame.\n        column_name: The name of the column to validate.\n\n    Returns:\n        True if all values in the column are valid datetime objects or NaNs, \n        False otherwise.

      "evaluation_response": "## Evaluation of Improved `duration_unit` Function\n\nThis revised function shows significant improvement over the previous version. Let's evaluate it based on the provided criteria:\n\n**1. Correctness:** The function correctly extracts time units from a wide range of input strings, including those with and without preceding numerical values.  The use of `str.extract` with the improved regex handles cases where only the unit is present more effectively.\n\n**2. Efficiency:** The use of pandas' vectorized `str.extract` significantly improves efficiency compared to the previous loop-based approach. This makes it much more scalable for large datasets. Time complexity is now largely determined by the pandas string operations, which are highly optimized. Space complexity remains O(n) due to the creation of the `units` Series.\n\n**3. Edge Case Handling:** The function now handles the case where the column name is missing, returning an empty Series. It also gracefully handles non-string values, converting them to NaN.  The `try-except` block catches potential `AttributeError` and `TypeError` exceptions, providing informative error messages.  It still doesn't explicitly handle cases with multiple units (e.g., \"1 hour 30 minutes\") in a single string;  it would select only the last unit mentioned.\n\n**4. Readability & Maintainability:** The code is well-structured and easy to understand.  The comments clearly explain the purpose and functionality. The use of vectorized operations enhances readability by reducing the amount of explicit looping.\n\n**5. Scalability:**  The vectorized approach using `str.extract` makes the function highly scalable. It avoids explicit looping, making it suitable for large datasets.\n\n**6. Security & Robustness:** No apparent security vulnerabilities.  The `try-except` block adds robustness by preventing crashes from unexpected input.\n\n**7. Generalizability:** The function is quite generalizable.  The regular expression could be easily modified to accommodate different time unit formats or additional units.\n\n**8. Data Handling & Type Safety:** The function handles various data types gracefully, converting values to strings before applying the regular expression.  Non-string values result in NaN, which is a sensible approach.\n\n**9. Error Handling:** The `try-except` block effectively catches and handles potential errors, providing informative error messages.\n\n**10. Output Consistency:** The function consistently returns a pandas Series, ensuring consistent output format, structure, and type.\n\n\n**Domain-Specific Considerations:**\n\n* **Numerical Data:** The function is not designed for numerical data. It expects string representations of durations.\n* **Categorical & Text Data:** The function is perfectly suited for categorical and text data representing durations.\n* **Date & Time Data:** The function does not directly handle datetime objects. It only works with string representations of durations.\n* **Geographical Data:** Not applicable.\n\n\n**Final Score:**\n\nThe improved function demonstrates excellent performance, scalability, and error handling. The use of vectorized operations significantly enhances efficiency.  While there's room for improvement in handling multiple units within a single string, the overall quality is high.\n\n```json\n{\"score\": 9}\n```",
      "score": 9,
      "optimize_prompt": "\n**Task:** Improve the following function based on the provided feedback.  \n\n#### **Feedback:**  \n## Evaluation of `duration_unit` Function\n\nHere's a detailed evaluation of the provided Python function based on the specified criteria:\n\n**1. Correctness:** The function generally works correctly for the intended purpose of extracting time units from strings. It handles various formats like \"10 seconds\", \"2.5 hours\", and even cases where only the unit is present (\"minutes\").\n\n**2. Efficiency:** The function uses regular expressions, which can be efficient for pattern matching. The time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of rows in the DataFrame column, because it iterates through each value.  Space complexity is also O(n) due to the creation of the `units` list.  For very large datasets,  vectorized operations using pandas' `str` accessor might offer a slight performance improvement.\n\n**3. Edge Case Handling:** The function handles the case where the column name is not found in the DataFrame. It also gracefully handles non-string values by assigning `None`. However, it could be improved by providing more informative error messages or logging for debugging.  It doesn't explicitly handle cases with multiple units in a single string (e.g., \"1 hour 30 minutes\").\n\n**4. Readability & Maintainability:** The code is well-structured and relatively easy to understand. The use of comments and meaningful variable names enhances readability.\n\n**5. Scalability:** While the current implementation is O(n), for extremely large datasets, a vectorized approach using pandas' string methods (e.g., `.str.extract`) would be more efficient.  The current loop-based approach could become slow for millions of rows.\n\n**6. Security & Robustness:** There are no apparent security vulnerabilities. The function handles input gracefully (though more robust error handling would be beneficial).\n\n**7. Generalizability:** The function is reasonably generalizable. It could be adapted to handle different time unit formats with minor modifications to the regular expression.\n\n**8. Data Handling & Type Safety:** The function explicitly checks for string data types.  It handles non-string values by assigning `None`.  More robust error handling could include raising exceptions for unexpected input types.\n\n**9. Error Handling:** The function includes basic error handling for a missing column.  More sophisticated error handling could be added to handle exceptions during regular expression matching or other unexpected situations. For instance, a `try-except` block around the `re.search` calls would prevent crashes if the regex engine encounters unexpected input.\n\n**10. Output Consistency:** The returned `units` list is consistent in its structure (a list) and the type of elements (strings or `None`).\n\n**Domain-Specific Considerations:**\n\n* **Numerical Data:** The function is *not* designed for numerical data. It explicitly works on strings.\n* **Categorical & Text Data:** The function is designed for categorical/text data representing durations.\n* **Date & Time Data:** The function does *not* handle date and time data directly.  It only extracts units from strings that *represent* durations, not datetime objects.\n* **Geographical Data:** Not applicable.\n\n\n**Final Score:**\n\nThe function is functional and reasonably well-written. However, improvements in error handling, scalability for large datasets, and handling more complex duration formats would elevate it.\n\n```json\n{\"score\": 7}\n```  \n\n#### **Function:**  \n```python  \n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport re\n\ndef duration_unit(df: pd.DataFrame, column_name: str) -> list:\n    \"\"\"\n    Extracts and returns the unit of time from a given duration value in a Pandas DataFrame column.\n\n    Args:\n        df: The input Pandas DataFrame.\n        column_name: The name of the column containing duration values.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of strings representing the units of time.

      "evaluation_response": "## Evaluation of `duration_unit` Function (Improved Version)\n\nHere's a detailed evaluation of the improved Python function:\n\n**1. Correctness:** The function correctly extracts time units from a specified column in a Pandas DataFrame using vectorized operations.  It handles various formats as intended.\n\n**2. Efficiency:** The use of pandas' vectorized `str.extract` significantly improves efficiency compared to a loop-based approach. The time complexity is now largely determined by the efficiency of the underlying pandas implementation, which is generally optimized for such operations. Space complexity remains O(n) due to the creation of the `units` Series, but this is often more efficient than creating a list in a loop.\n\n**3. Edge Case Handling:** The function effectively handles:\n    * **Missing data:**  `NaN` values are implicitly handled by `astype(str)`.\n    * **Non-string data:**  `astype(str)` converts non-string values to their string representation.\n    * **No match:** The `try-except` block catches `AttributeError` (if no match is found) and `ValueError` (if other extraction errors occur), returning a list of `None` values with the same length as the input column. This is a significant improvement over the previous version.\n    * **Column not found:** It correctly returns an empty list if the specified column doesn't exist.\n\n**4. Readability & Maintainability:** The code is well-structured and concise. The use of vectorized operations makes it more readable and easier to maintain than the loop-based version. The docstring is clear and informative.\n\n**5. Scalability:** The vectorized approach makes the function highly scalable.  It efficiently handles large datasets because pandas operations are optimized for this.\n\n**6. Security & Robustness:** No security vulnerabilities are present.  The function operates solely on DataFrame data, without external input or interactions that could introduce risks.\n\n**7. Generalizability:** The function is highly generalizable.  It can be applied to various datasets with minimal modification.  The regular expression could be adjusted to accommodate different duration formats if necessary.\n\n**8. Data Handling & Type Safety:** The function uses `astype(str)` to ensure that all values in the column are treated as strings before applying the regular expression.  This handles potential type errors gracefully.  The conversion to lowercase is also a good practice for consistency.\n\n**9. Error Handling:** The `try-except` block effectively catches potential errors during the string extraction process, preventing unexpected crashes.  This is a key improvement over the previous version.\n\n**10. Output Consistency:** The function consistently returns a list of strings (or a list of `None` values if extraction fails for all rows).\n\n\n**Domain-Specific Considerations:**\n\n* **Numerical Data:** The function is designed for text-based duration representations (e.g., \"10s\", \"2.5 hours\").  It does *not* directly handle numerical representations of duration (e.g., a column of seconds).\n* **Categorical & Text Data:**  It's perfectly suited for categorical/text data representing durations in string format.\n* **Date & Time Data:** The function does not handle date and time data directly. It assumes durations are already expressed as strings with units.\n* **Geographical Data:** Not applicable.\n\n\n**Final Score:**\n\n```json\n{\"score\": 9}\n```\n\nThe improved function demonstrates excellent performance, scalability, and error handling.  It's a significant improvement over the previous version.  A score of 9 reflects its high quality and efficiency, with only minor potential improvements (like adding more specific exception handling if needed for particular scenarios).",

      "optimize_prompt": "\n**Task:** Improve the following function based on the provided feedback.  \n\n#### **Feedback:**  \n## Evaluation of `duration_unit` Function\n\nHere's a detailed evaluation of the provided Python function based on the specified criteria:\n\n**1. Correctness:** The function generally works correctly for its intended purpose of extracting time units from strings. The regular expression is reasonably robust, capturing various formats (e.g., \"10s\", \"2.5 hours\", \"1 day\"). However, it might fail if the format deviates significantly from the expected pattern (e.g.,  \"10 seconds\" instead of \"10s\").\n\n**2. Efficiency:** The function's efficiency is good for moderately sized DataFrames. It iterates through the column once, making its time complexity O(n), where n is the number of rows. The space complexity is also O(n) due to the creation of the `units` list.  For very large datasets, vectorized operations using pandas' built-in string functions might offer a slight performance improvement.\n\n**3. Edge Case Handling:** The function handles `NaN` values and non-string values gracefully by appending `None` to the `units` list.  It also handles cases where no unit is found in the string.  However, it doesn't explicitly handle potential errors from the regular expression matching (though `re.search` is generally robust).\n\n\n**4. Readability & Maintainability:** The code is well-structured and easy to understand. Variable names are meaningful, and the docstring clearly explains the function's purpose, arguments, and return value.  The use of a regular expression makes the code concise but might require some familiarity with regex for modification.\n\n**5. Scalability:** The function's linear time complexity makes it reasonably scalable.  For extremely large datasets, consider using pandas' vectorized string operations for potential performance gains.\n\n**6. Security & Robustness:** There are no apparent security vulnerabilities. The function primarily deals with string manipulation and doesn't interact with external resources or user inputs that could introduce security risks.\n\n**7. Generalizability:** The function is reasonably generalizable. It can be applied to different datasets with minimal modification, as long as the duration column follows a similar format (number followed by a unit).  Adapting the regular expression might be necessary for significantly different formats.\n\n**8. Data Handling & Type Safety:** The function explicitly checks for `NaN` and non-string values, demonstrating good data type handling.  It correctly handles the conversion of matched units to lowercase.\n\n**9. Error Handling:**  The function doesn't include explicit `try-except` blocks. While the `re.search` function is generally robust, adding error handling could make the function even more robust (e.g., catching potential `AttributeError` if the regex match fails unexpectedly).\n\n**10. Output Consistency:** The function consistently returns a list of strings (or `None` values), ensuring consistent output format and type.\n\n**Domain-Specific Considerations:**\n\n* **Numerical Data:** The function is *not* designed for numerical duration data (e.g., duration represented as seconds).  It expects strings.\n* **Categorical & Text Data:** The function works well with categorical text data representing durations, provided the format is consistent with the regular expression.\n* **Date & Time Data:** The function is not designed to handle date and time data directly.  It assumes the duration is already expressed as a string with a unit (e.g., \"2 days\").\n* **Geographical Data:** Not applicable to this function.\n\n\n**Final Score:**\n\n```json\n{\"score\": 8}\n```\n\nThe function is well-written and mostly robust.

      "evaluation_response": "## Evaluation of the Further Improved `date_format` Function\n\nThis version addresses many of the previous issues, particularly error handling and format inference. Let's evaluate it against the criteria:\n\n**1. Correctness:** The function is significantly more correct. The improved error handling prevents crashes from bad date strings. The more comprehensive `strftime` format (`%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S`) in the format inference is better at capturing the nuances of parsed dates.  However, it still assumes a single dominant format. If multiple formats are present and equally frequent, it might not accurately reflect the data.  It also doesn't explicitly handle timezone information.\n\n\n**2. Efficiency:**  The function remains efficient. The use of `apply` with a custom parsing function is generally efficient for most datasets.  The time complexity is still largely dominated by `dateutil.parser.parse`, which is optimized. Space complexity is reasonable.\n\n**3. Edge Case Handling:**  The function handles missing data (`dropna`), non-string values, and leading/trailing whitespace.  The `try-except` block in `parse_date_with_error_handling` effectively manages parsing errors.  It gracefully handles cases where no dates are parsed successfully.  However, it still might be overly lenient with ambiguous dates due to `fuzzy=True`.\n\n**4. Readability & Maintainability:** The code is well-structured, readable, and maintainable. The use of a separate function for date parsing improves clarity and organization.  Comments are helpful.\n\n**5. Scalability:** The function scales well due to the vectorized operations and the efficiency of `dateutil`.  It avoids explicit loops that would be detrimental to performance with large datasets.\n\n**6. Security & Robustness:** No security vulnerabilities are apparent. The robustness is greatly improved through better error handling.\n\n**7. Generalizability:** The function is reasonably generalizable.  The use of `dateutil` improves its ability to handle diverse date formats. However,  inferring the *exact* format string remains a challenge, especially with complex or inconsistent date patterns.\n\n**8. Data Handling & Type Safety:**  Data type validation is present and effective.  `NaN` values and non-string data are handled correctly.\n\n**9. Error Handling:** The `try-except` block is a significant improvement in error handling.  It prevents crashes from parsing errors.  However, it might be beneficial to log the errors or provide more informative feedback to the user about which dates failed to parse.\n\n**10. Output Consistency:** The function consistently returns a string (the inferred format) or `None`.\n\n\n**Domain-Specific Considerations:**\n\n* **Numerical Data:** Not applicable.\n* **Categorical & Text Data:** Applies to text data representing dates.\n* **Date & Time Data:** Handles date and time data to a reasonable degree. The format inference now includes time components, which is a significant improvement. However, it doesn't explicitly handle timezones.\n* **Geographical Data:** Not applicable.\n\n\n**Final Score:**\n\nThis version is a solid improvement.  The error handling and more comprehensive format inference are significant enhancements.  However, the assumption of a single dominant format and the lack of explicit timezone handling prevent a perfect score.\n\n```json\n{\"score\": 9}\n```",

      "optimize_prompt": "\n**Task:** Improve the following function based on the provided feedback.  \n\n#### **Feedback:**  \n## Evaluation of the Improved `date_format` Function\n\nThe revised `date_format` function shows significant improvement over the previous version by leveraging the `dateutil` library for date parsing.  However, it still has some areas that could be refined.\n\n**1. Correctness:** The function is more correct than the previous version because `dateutil.parser.parse` is more robust at handling various date formats.  However, it still relies on a simplified format inference step (`strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d\")`). This means that if the most common parsed date doesn't neatly fit that format, the result might be inaccurate.  It also assumes a single consistent date format within the column; if there's a mix of formats that all parse correctly, it will return only one.\n\n**2. Efficiency:** Using `dateutil` and Pandas' vectorized operations (`apply`) is a significant improvement in efficiency compared to the previous loop-based regex approach.  The time complexity is now largely determined by `dateutil.parser.parse`, which is generally efficient but can be slower for extremely complex or ambiguous dates.  The space complexity is relatively low as it primarily stores the date strings and parsed dates.\n\n**3. Edge Case Handling:** The function handles missing data (`dropna`) and non-string values effectively. It also cleans up leading/trailing whitespace using `.str.strip()`.  However, it doesn't explicitly handle cases where `dateutil.parser.parse` might raise an exception for truly malformed date strings (though `fuzzy=True` helps mitigate this).  Adding a `try-except` block would improve robustness.\n\n**4. Readability & Maintainability:** The code is well-structured and readable. Variable names are descriptive, and comments explain the logic clearly.  The use of `dateutil` simplifies the code and makes it easier to maintain.\n\n**5. Scalability:** The use of Pandas' vectorized `apply` and the efficient `dateutil` library makes the function much more scalable than the previous version.  It should perform well on large datasets because it avoids explicit looping.\n\n**6. Security & Robustness:**  There are no apparent security vulnerabilities. The robustness is improved by `dateutil`, but it is not completely foolproof against all possible malformed date strings.\n\n**7. Generalizability:** The function is more generalizable than the previous version because `dateutil` automatically handles a wider range of date formats.  However, the format inference step is still somewhat limited.  A more sophisticated approach might involve analyzing the parsed dates to determine a more accurate and precise format string.\n\n**8. Data Handling & Type Safety:** The function performs appropriate type checking and handles `NaN` values correctly.  The conversion to string and stripping of whitespace are good defensive programming practices.\n\n**9. Error Handling:** Error handling could be improved by adding a `try-except` block around `dateutil.parser.parse` to catch potential parsing errors and handle them gracefully (e.g., by logging the error or skipping the problematic row).\n\n**10. Output Consistency:** The function consistently returns a string representing the inferred date format or `None`.\n\n\n**Domain-Specific Considerations:**\n\n* **Numerical Data:** Not applicable.\n* **Categorical & Text Data:**  Applies to text data representing dates.\n* **Date & Time Data:** Handles date data reasonably well, but it doesn't explicitly extract time components.  The `fuzzy=True` parameter in `dateutil.parser.parse` makes it more robust with times included, but the format inference then becomes even more challenging.\n* **Geographical Data:** Not applicable.\n\n\n**Final Score:**\n\nThe improved function is a substantial step up, addressing many of the previous version's shortcomings.  However, the simplified format inference and lack of comprehensive error handling prevent it from achieving a higher score.\n\n```json\n{\"score\": 8}\n```  \n\n#### **Function:**  \n```python  \n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport dateutil.parser\n\ndef date_format(df, column_name):\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the most common date format in a DataFrame column using dateutil.\n\n    Args:\n        df: pandas DataFrame.\n        column_name: str, name of the column containing dates.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The most frequent date format string or None if no consistent format is found.\n             Raises exceptions for invalid inputs.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(df, pd.DataFrame):\n        raise TypeError(\"Input 'df' must be a pandas DataFrame.\")\n    if not isinstance(column_name, str):\n        raise TypeError(\"Input 'column_name' must be a string.\")\n    if column_name not in df.columns:\n        raise ValueError(f\"Column '{column_name}' not found in DataFrame.\")\n\n    date_column = df[column_name]\n    \n    #Handle non-string and NaN values efficiently\n    date_strings = date_column.dropna().astype(str).str.strip()\n    if date_strings.empty:\n        return None\n\n    #Attempt parsing with dateutil; handles various formats\n    parsed_dates = date_strings.apply(lambda x: dateutil.parser.parse(x, fuzzy=True))\n\n\n    #Infer format from parsed dates (simplified for demonstration)\n    format_counts = {}\n    for date in parsed_dates:\n        format_str = date.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d\") #Or other desired default format\n        format_counts[format_str] = format_counts.get(format_str, 0) + 1\n\n    if not format_counts:\n        return None #No dates parsed successfully\n\n    most_frequent_format = max(format_counts, key=format_counts.get)\n    if sum(format_counts.values()) == format_counts[most_frequent_format]:\n        return most_frequent_format\n    else:\n        return None #Multiple formats still detected\n\n```  \n```\n#### **Instructions:**  \n- **Return only the optimized function**\u2014do not generate anything else.  \n- Optimize for **performance, readability, maintainability, and scalability**.  \n- Ensure **efficient error handling** and **edge case coverage**.  \n- The function should accept **a Pandas DataFrame and a column name**\u2014optimize it accordingly.  \n- **Enhance compatibility with large datasets** by avoiding memory-intensive operations.  \n- Maintain a **consistent return type** and predictable output behavior.  \n- Use **best practices for numerical computations, data validation, and type safety**.  \n- Prefer **vectorized operations over loops** for better efficiency.  \n- If applicable, utilize **optimized Pandas/NumPy functions** for improved performance.  \n\n#### **Key Enhancements in This Version:**  \n\u2705 **Clearer structure**\u2014separates feedback, function, and instructions for better readability.  \n\u2705 **Stronger emphasis on key optimizations**\u2014efficiency, scalability, and best practices.  \n\u2705 **Explicit dataset handling guidance**\u2014ensures seamless performance on large data.  \n\u2705 **More direct and action-driven language**\u2014ensures precision in function improvement.  \n                        ",

      "evaluation_response": "## Evaluation of the Improved `date_format` Function\n\nThe revised `date_format` function shows significant improvements over the previous version, addressing many of the earlier concerns.\n\n**1. Correctness:** The function now correctly identifies the *most frequent* date format in a column, making it much more robust to inconsistencies in the data.  It handles cases where multiple formats might exist, providing a more practical solution.\n\n**2. Efficiency:** The pre-compilation of regular expressions (`compiled_regexes`) is a significant improvement. This avoids repeated compilation, boosting performance, especially for larger datasets. The use of Pandas' vectorized `str.match` further enhances efficiency compared to the previous nested loop approach. The time complexity is now closer to O(n*m) where n is the number of rows and m is the number of regexes but the constant factor is reduced significantly due to vectorization.\n\n**3. Edge Case Handling:**  Missing data (`NaN`) is handled correctly.  The function doesn't explicitly validate date validity (e.g., Feb 30th), which remains an area for potential improvement.  Error handling for invalid DataFrame input and missing columns is still present.\n\n**4. Readability & Maintainability:** The code remains well-structured and readable. Variable names are clear, and comments are concise and helpful.  The use of a dictionary for formats and the pre-compilation step enhance maintainability.\n\n**5. Scalability:**  The use of vectorized operations makes the function much more scalable.  It should handle large datasets significantly better than the previous version.\n\n**6. Security & Robustness:** No obvious security vulnerabilities.  The use of compiled regular expressions adds a layer of efficiency without compromising security.\n\n**7. Generalizability:** The function is easily generalizable.  Adding new date formats only requires updating the `formats` dictionary.\n\n**8. Data Handling & Type Safety:** Data type validation for the DataFrame is present.  The conversion to strings handles potential issues with mixed data types in the date column.\n\n**9. Error Handling:** Error handling is sufficient for common issues like invalid DataFrame or column names.  Adding a `try-except` block for potential `re.error` exceptions would improve robustness further (although unlikely with well-formed regexes).\n\n**10. Output Consistency:** The output is consistently a string representing the most frequent date format or `None` if no dates are found.\n\n**Domain-Specific Considerations:**\n\n* **Numerical Data:** The function is still not applicable to numerical data.\n* **Categorical & Text Data:**  Similarly, it's not designed for categorical or text data unless they happen to contain date strings.\n* **Date & Time Data:**  The function only handles date components, not time or time zones.\n* **Geographical Data:** Not applicable.\n\n**Final Score:**\n\nThe improved function demonstrates a significant improvement in efficiency and robustness. The use of vectorized operations and pre-compiled regular expressions addresses the scalability concerns.  While date validity checking could be added, the current implementation is a substantial improvement. I would give this function a score of **9/10**.\n\n```json\n{\"score\": 9}\n```",
      "score": 9,
      "optimize_prompt": "\n**Task:** Improve the following function based on the provided feedback.  \n\n#### **Feedback:**  \n## Evaluation of the `date_format` Function\n\nThe `date_format` function demonstrates a good attempt at identifying date formats within a Pandas DataFrame column. However, there are areas for improvement in terms of robustness, efficiency, and handling of edge cases.\n\n**1. Correctness:**\n\nThe function correctly identifies several common date formats using regular expressions.  It accurately handles cases with consistent formatting within a column. However, it fails if there's even one date with an unexpected format in the column, returning `None`. This is overly strict.  A more robust approach might identify the *most common* format, or return a list of detected formats with their frequencies.\n\n**2. Efficiency:**\n\nThe efficiency is reasonable for smaller datasets. The nested loop structure (iterating through dates and then through regex patterns) has a time complexity of O(n*m), where n is the number of dates and m is the number of regex patterns. For very large datasets, this could become slow.  A more efficient approach might involve using Pandas' vectorized string operations or a more sophisticated pattern matching library.\n\n**3. Edge Case Handling:**\n\n* **Missing Data:** The function correctly handles `NaN` values using `dropna()`.\n* **Extreme Values:**  The regex patterns implicitly handle extreme values (e.g., the last day of the year). However, it doesn't explicitly validate the *validity* of the dates (e.g., February 30th).\n* **Errors:** The function includes good error handling for invalid DataFrame input and missing columns.\n\n**4. Readability & Maintainability:**\n\nThe code is well-structured and readable.  Variable names are meaningful, and the comments are helpful.  The use of a dictionary for date formats improves maintainability\u2014adding new formats is relatively easy.\n\n**5. Scalability:**\n\nAs mentioned, the nested loop approach limits scalability.  For large datasets, optimizing this aspect is crucial.  Vectorization (using Pandas' `str.match` with a compiled regex) would significantly improve performance.\n\n**6. Security & Robustness:**\n\nNo immediate security vulnerabilities are apparent.  The function's reliance on regular expressions makes it relatively safe from injection attacks.\n\n**7. Generalizability:**\n\nThe function is reasonably generalizable.  It could be adapted to other date formats by adding more regex patterns to the `formats` dictionary.\n\n**8. Data Handling & Type Safety:**\n\nThe function correctly handles the conversion of the date column to strings.  It explicitly checks the DataFrame type, which is good practice.\n\n**9. Error Handling:**\n\nError handling is implemented well for DataFrame and column errors.  However, it could benefit from handling potential `re.error` exceptions (though this is less likely with carefully crafted regexes).\n\n**10. Output Consistency:**\n\nThe output is consistent: either a string representing the date format or `None`.\n\n**Domain-Specific Considerations:**\n\n* **Numerical Data:** The function is not applicable to numerical data.  The code explicitly checks for date-like strings.\n* **Categorical & Text Data:** The function is not applicable to categorical or text data unless those columns happen to contain date strings.\n* **Date & Time Data:** The function handles date data but not time components.  It would need modification to handle timezones and more complex datetime formats.\n* **Geographical Data:**  The function is not designed for geographical data.\n\n**Final Score:**\n\nConsidering the strengths and weaknesses, I'd give this function a score of **7/10**.  It's functional and well-structured but could be significantly improved in efficiency and robustness by using vectorized operations and handling a wider variety of date formats and potential inconsistencies within a column.

      "evaluation_response": "## Evaluation of the `is_phone` Function\n\nThis improved version of `is_phone` shows significant enhancements in robustness and error handling. Let's evaluate it based on the criteria:\n\n**1. Correctness:** The function's correctness depends heavily on the comprehensiveness of the regular expression. The updated `phone_pattern` is better than the previous version, attempting to cover a wider range of international and common formats. However,  no regex can perfectly capture *every* valid phone number format globally due to the sheer variety.  It will likely still have false positives (incorrectly identifying invalid numbers as valid) or false negatives (missing some valid numbers).  Thorough testing with a diverse dataset is crucial.\n\n**2. Efficiency:** The function remains efficient. The use of vectorized operations (`str.match`) within Pandas ensures that the regex is applied to the entire column at once, avoiding slow Python loops. Time and space complexity remain favorable for large datasets.\n\n**3. Edge Case Handling:**\n    * **Missing Data:**  `str.match(..., na=False)` correctly handles missing (NaN) values by treating them as non-matches.\n    * **Extreme Values:** The regex is improved, but extremely long or short numbers might still be misclassified.  Numbers with unusual characters are also likely to be rejected.\n    * **Errors:** The `TypeError` check for the DataFrame input is excellent. The handling of a missing column is also appropriate.\n\n**4. Readability & Maintainability:** The code is well-structured and readable.  The comments are helpful. The regular expression is somewhat complex, but its intent is clear.  Maintainability is good.\n\n**5. Scalability:** The vectorized approach ensures good scalability.  The function should perform well on large datasets without significant performance degradation.\n\n**6. Security & Robustness:** No security vulnerabilities are apparent. The function operates only on the provided data.\n\n**7. Generalizability:** The function is more generalizable than the previous version due to the improved regex. However, to make it truly general, one might need a more sophisticated approach, perhaps using a dedicated phone number parsing library that can handle various international formats and variations.\n\n**8. Data Handling & Type Safety:**  The explicit `astype(str)` conversion handles various data types within the column. The `TypeError` check adds a layer of type safety.\n\n**9. Error Handling:** The error handling is improved with the `TypeError` check.  More sophisticated error handling (e.g., catching specific `re.error` exceptions if the regex is malformed) could be added.\n\n**10. Output Consistency:** The output is consistently a Pandas Series of boolean values.\n\n\n**Domain-Specific Considerations:**\n\n* **Numerical Data:**  The function is not designed for numerical data and correctly handles them by converting to strings.\n* **Categorical & Text Data:** The function is designed for text data (phone numbers).\n* **Date & Time Data:** Not applicable.\n* **Geographical Data:** Not applicable.\n\n\n**Final Score:**\n\nThe improved function is a solid improvement over the original. The enhanced regex and error handling make it more robust.  However, the regex could be further refined for even greater accuracy, and more comprehensive error handling could be added.\n\n```json\n{\"score\": 9}\n```",
      "score": 9,
      "optimize_prompt": "\n**Task:** Improve the following function based on the provided feedback.  \n\n#### **Feedback:**  \n## Evaluation of the `is_phone` Function\n\nThe `is_phone` function demonstrates a good approach to phone number validation within a Pandas DataFrame context. However, there are areas for improvement.\n\n**1. Correctness:** The function generally works correctly for the phone number formats it's designed to handle. The regular expression `phone_pattern` captures several common US phone number formats.  However, it's not exhaustive and might miss some valid formats or incorrectly identify invalid ones depending on international variations.\n\n**2. Efficiency:** The use of Pandas' vectorized `str.match` method is efficient for large DataFrames. It avoids explicit looping, which significantly improves performance compared to iterating row by row.  The time complexity is largely determined by the underlying Pandas implementation of `str.match`, which is generally optimized. Space complexity is relatively low, primarily related to the size of the DataFrame and the resulting boolean Series.\n\n**3. Edge Case Handling:**\n    * **Missing Data:** The function implicitly handles missing values (NaN, None, empty strings) because `astype(str)` converts them to empty strings, which the regex doesn't match. This is a reasonable approach.\n    * **Extreme Values:** The regex handles numbers with varying lengths and formats to some extent.  However, exceptionally long or short numbers might still slip through.\n    * **Errors:** The function handles the case where the specified column doesn't exist by returning an empty Series. This is good error handling.\n\n**4. Readability & Maintainability:** The code is well-structured and easy to understand. The use of a descriptive variable name (`phone_pattern`) and comments enhances readability.  The function is reasonably maintainable.\n\n**5. Scalability:**  The vectorized nature of the Pandas operations makes the function scalable to large datasets.  Performance should remain acceptable even with substantial increases in data size.\n\n**6. Security & Robustness:** There are no apparent security vulnerabilities.  The function operates solely on the provided DataFrame data and doesn't interact with external resources.\n\n**7. Generalizability:** The function is relatively generalizable.  The `phone_pattern` could be modified to accommodate different phone number formats (e.g., international variations) by adjusting the regular expression.\n\n**8. Data Handling & Type Safety:** The function explicitly converts the column to strings using `astype(str)`. This handles various data types within the column consistently.\n\n**9. Error Handling:** The error handling for a missing column is adequate.  More robust error handling might involve checking the DataFrame's type to ensure it's a Pandas DataFrame.\n\n**10. Output Consistency:** The function consistently returns a Pandas Series of boolean values, ensuring consistent output regardless of input.\n\n\n**Domain-Specific Considerations:**\n\n* **Numerical Data:** The function is *not* designed for numerical data.  It explicitly converts the input to strings, making numerical operations irrelevant.\n* **Categorical & Text Data:** The function is primarily designed for categorical and text data (specifically, phone numbers represented as strings).\n* **Date & Time Data:** The function is not suitable for date and time data.\n* **Geographical Data:** The function is not designed to handle geographical data.\n\n\n**Final Score:**\n\nThe function is well-written and efficient for its intended purpose.  The primary limitation is the relatively narrow scope of phone number formats it handles and the lack of extensive error handling beyond a missing column.  With a more comprehensive regex and minor enhancements, it could be significantly improved.\n\n```json\n{\"score\": 8}\n```  \n\n#### **Function:**  \n```python  \n```python\nimport re\n\ndef is_phone(df, column_name):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if values in a specified DataFrame column are valid phone numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        df: The input Pandas DataFrame.\n        column_name: The name of the column containing phone numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        A Pandas Series of boolean values indicating whether each entry \n        in the specified column is a valid phone number.

      "evaluation_response": "## Evaluation of `is_phone` Function\n\nHere's a detailed evaluation of the improved `is_phone` function:\n\n**1. Correctness:** The function is more correct than the previous version due to the improved regex. The updated regex `r\"^(?:\\+?1[-.\\s]?)?\\(?\\d{3}\\)?[-.\\s]?\\d{3}[-.\\s]?\\d{4}$\"` handles a wider variety of common US phone number formats, including variations in separators and optional country codes. However, it's still not completely exhaustive and might still miss some edge cases or incorrectly flag some invalid numbers.  A truly comprehensive solution would require a more sophisticated approach, potentially using a dedicated phone number validation library.\n\n**2. Efficiency:** The function remains efficient. It leverages pandas' vectorized string operations (`str.match`), avoiding explicit Python loops, which leads to good performance, especially on large DataFrames. The time complexity is still largely determined by the size of the DataFrame and the regex complexity, but it's optimized for speed.  Space complexity is also reasonable.\n\n**3. Edge Case Handling:**\n    * **Missing Data:** Handled correctly; NaN values are converted to strings and don't match the pattern.\n    * **Extreme Values:** The regex itself constrains the length of potential matches, preventing issues with extremely long strings.  Very short numbers would also fail to match.\n    * **Errors:** The `try-except` block effectively catches `TypeError` exceptions that might occur during the `astype(str)` conversion, preventing crashes and providing informative error messages. The case of a missing column is also gracefully handled.\n\n**4. Readability & Maintainability:** The code is well-structured, readable, and uses meaningful variable names.  The comments are clear and helpful. The regex itself is slightly more complex but still relatively understandable.\n\n**5. Scalability:**  The function remains highly scalable due to the use of vectorized pandas operations. It should handle large datasets efficiently without significant performance degradation.\n\n**6. Security & Robustness:** No security vulnerabilities are apparent.  Input handling is well-managed, and the `try-except` block adds robustness.\n\n**7. Generalizability:**  The function is more generalizable than the original version but is still limited by the regex's focus on US phone numbers.  Modifying the regex to encompass international formats would require significant changes.  A more modular design (separating the regex from the core logic) would improve generalizability.\n\n**8. Data Handling & Type Safety:** The `astype(str)` conversion ensures that the regex operates on strings, regardless of the original data type in the column.  The `try-except` block handles potential `TypeError` exceptions during this conversion.\n\n**9. Error Handling:** The `try-except` block provides good error handling for `TypeError` exceptions during type conversion.  More comprehensive error handling could include checks for other potential issues (e.g., invalid column names).\n\n**10. Output Consistency:** The function consistently returns a pandas Series of booleans, maintaining output consistency.\n\n\n**Domain-Specific Considerations:**\n\n* **Numerical Data:** Not applicable; the function is designed for text data.\n* **Categorical & Text Data:** Works well for categorical and text columns containing phone numbers.\n* **Date & Time Data:** Not applicable.\n* **Geographical Data:** Not applicable.\n\n\n**Final Score:**\n\nThe improved function demonstrates significant enhancements in error handling and regex accuracy.  While the regex could be further refined for broader international number support, and a more modular design would improve generalizability, the current implementation is robust, efficient, and well-structured.\n\n```json\n{\"score\": 9}\n```",

      "optimize_prompt": "\n**Task:** Improve the following function based on the provided feedback.  \n\n#### **Feedback:**  \n## Evaluation of `is_phone` Function\n\nHere's a detailed evaluation of the provided Python function based on the given criteria:\n\n**1. Correctness:** The function generally works correctly for phone numbers matching the defined regex pattern. It correctly identifies numbers with country codes, parentheses, hyphens, and spaces. However, it might miss some valid formats or incorrectly identify invalid ones depending on the regex's comprehensiveness.  The regex is US-centric and may need adjustments for international numbers.\n\n**2. Efficiency:** The function uses vectorized operations via pandas' `str.match()`, which is efficient for large DataFrames.  The time complexity is largely dependent on the size of the DataFrame and the regex complexity, but it avoids explicit looping, making it relatively efficient. Space complexity is also reasonable as it primarily uses the DataFrame and a regex pattern.\n\n**3. Edge Case Handling:**\n    * **Missing Data:** The function implicitly handles missing data (NaN) because `astype(str)` converts NaN to 'nan', which won't match the phone number pattern.\n    * **Extreme Values:** The function doesn't have specific handling for extreme values (very long numbers, etc.) but the regex itself limits the length to a reasonable range.\n    * **Errors:** The function gracefully handles cases where the column doesn't exist by returning an empty Series.  It doesn't explicitly catch other errors (though unlikely with `str.match`).\n\n**4. Readability & Maintainability:** The code is well-structured and readable. The use of a regex pattern makes the core logic clear and concise.  Variable names are descriptive. Comments are helpful but could be slightly more detailed explaining regex choices.\n\n**5. Scalability:** The use of vectorized operations makes the function scalable to large datasets.  Performance should remain relatively linear with the number of rows in the DataFrame.\n\n**6. Security & Robustness:** There are no apparent security vulnerabilities. The function doesn't interact with external resources or user inputs that could lead to injection attacks.\n\n**7. Generalizability:** The function is relatively generalizable.  Modifying the regex pattern can adapt it to different phone number formats (e.g., international numbers). The function's core logic (applying a regex to a column) is applicable beyond phone numbers.\n\n**8. Data Handling & Type Safety:** The function explicitly converts the column to strings (`astype(str)`) before applying the regex. This handles various data types in the column, ensuring the regex operates on strings.\n\n**9. Error Handling:** While the function handles the missing column case, adding a `try-except` block to catch potential `TypeError` exceptions during the `astype(str)` conversion would enhance robustness.\n\n**10. Output Consistency:** The function consistently returns a pandas Series of booleans, which is consistent and easily interpretable.\n\n\n**Domain-Specific Considerations:**\n\n* **Numerical Data:** The function is not designed for numerical data. Applying it to a numerical column would yield mostly False results (unless the numbers coincidentally match the phone number pattern).\n* **Categorical & Text Data:** The function is primarily designed for text data (specifically, phone numbers). It works well for categorical columns containing phone numbers as strings.\n* **Date & Time Data:** The function is not applicable to date and time data.\n* **Geographical Data:** The function is not applicable to geographical data.\n\n\n\n**Final Score:**\n\nThe function is well-implemented and efficient for its intended purpose.  Minor improvements (adding a `try-except` block and potentially clarifying comments) would further enhance it.\n\n\n```json\n{\"score\": 8}\n```  \n\n#### **Function:**  \n```python  \n```python\nimport re\n\ndef is_phone(df, column_name):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if values in a specified dataframe column are valid phone numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        df: The input pandas DataFrame.\n        column_name: The name of the column containing phone numbers.\n\n    Returns:\n        A pandas Series of booleans indicating whether each value in the \n        specified column is a valid phone number.

Correctness:** The function is more correct than the previous version. The improved regular expression is more robust, though still not perfect (no regex can perfectly capture all valid email addresses according to the RFC standard).  It correctly handles many edge cases, including empty strings and `None` values.\n\n**2. Efficiency:** The function remains efficient due to the use of vectorized operations in Pandas.  The time complexity is largely determined by the size of the input DataFrame and is likely linear. Space complexity is also relatively low, primarily determined by the size of the DataFrame and the intermediate Series.\n\n**3. Edge Case Handling:** The function now explicitly handles:\n    * Missing data (`None` values):  Handled by `fillna('')`.\n    * Empty strings: Handled by `str.strip()`.\n    * Numeric columns: Returns `False` for all values in the column.\n    * Non-string columns (after handling numeric): Returns `False` for all values.\n    * Column not found: Returns an empty Series.\n    * Invalid DataFrame input: Raises a `TypeError`.\n\nThe error handling is improved with more specific exception handling and logging.\n\n**4. Readability & Maintainability:** The code is well-structured, with clear comments and meaningful variable names.  The logic is easy to follow.\n\n**5. Scalability:** The vectorized approach using Pandas ensures good scalability.  The function should perform well even with very large datasets.\n\n**6. Security & Robustness:** No apparent security vulnerabilities. Input validation prevents unexpected behaviors.\n\n**7. Generalizability:** The function is easily adaptable to different datasets and column names.\n\n**8. Data Handling & Type Safety:**  The function correctly checks for numeric data types using `pd.api.types.is_numeric_dtype` and handles them appropriately.  Type conversions are handled carefully with error checking.\n\n**9. Error Handling:** The `try-except` block is improved by catching specific exceptions and providing informative error messages.  The error logging is helpful for debugging.\n\n**10. Output Consistency:** The function consistently returns a Pandas Series of boolean values, an empty Series, or raises an exception as appropriate.\n\n\n**Domain-Specific Considerations:**\n\n* **Numerical Data:** Handled correctly; returns all `False`.\n* **Categorical & Text Data:** Works well for text data containing email addresses; handles categorical data appropriately if the column contains string representations of email addresses.\n* **Date & Time Data:**  Not designed for date/time data;  would return incorrect results if applied to such columns.\n* **Geographical Data:** Not applicable.\n\n\n**Final Score:**\n\n{\"score\": 9}\n\nThe improved function is robust, efficient, and well-written.

      "optimize_prompt": "\n**Task:** Improve the following function based on the provided feedback.  \n\n#### **Feedback:**  \n## Evaluation of the `is_email` Function\n\nThe `is_email` function demonstrates a good attempt at email validation within a Pandas DataFrame context. However, it has areas for improvement.\n\n**1. Correctness:** The function generally works correctly for simple email formats.  The regular expression is a reasonable starting point but isn't exhaustive.  It will miss some valid emails and might incorrectly identify some invalid ones as valid (depending on the complexity of the email address).\n\n**2. Efficiency:** The use of vectorized operations (`str.match`) on the Pandas Series is efficient for large DataFrames.  The regular expression itself is reasonably optimized.\n\n**3. Edge Case Handling:**  The function handles missing data (None values) well because `astype(str)` converts `None` to 'None', which the regex doesn't match. It also gracefully handles non-string columns by returning a series of `False` values.  However, it doesn't explicitly handle empty strings, which might be considered invalid emails.\n\n\n**4. Readability & Maintainability:** The code is well-structured and easy to understand.  The use of comments and meaningful variable names enhances readability.\n\n**5. Scalability:** The vectorized approach using Pandas makes the function scalable to large datasets.  The performance should remain relatively linear with the number of rows.\n\n**6. Security & Robustness:** There are no apparent security vulnerabilities.  The function focuses solely on validation and doesn't interact with external resources.\n\n**7. Generalizability:** The function is easily generalizable to other DataFrames and column names.\n\n**8. Data Handling & Type Safety:** The function explicitly handles type conversions using `astype(str)`. The `try-except` block catches potential errors during type conversion.\n\n**9. Error Handling:**  The `try-except` block effectively catches `AttributeError` and `TypeError` exceptions that might occur if the column doesn't have string-like values. However, it could benefit from more specific error handling and logging for better debugging.\n\n**10.

It will attempt to convert numerical values to strings, which might lead to unexpected results depending on the regex. The function should explicitly check if the column is numeric and handle it appropriately (perhaps raise an error or return an empty Series).\n\n* **Categorical & Text Data:** The function is primarily designed for text data (specifically, email addresses).  It works well for categorical columns containing email addresses.\n\n* **Date & Time Data:** The function is not designed for date and time data.

      "evaluation_response": "## Evaluation of the `is_email` Function\n\nThis version of the `is_email` function demonstrates significant improvements in error handling and input validation. Let's evaluate it based on the provided criteria:\n\n**1. Correctness:** The function's core logic\u2014using a regular expression for email validation\u2014is sound but not perfect. The regex used is a reasonable approximation but might not catch all valid email addresses or might incorrectly identify some invalid ones as valid.  The correctness is limited by the limitations of the regex itself.\n\n**2. Efficiency:** The function is efficient.  It uses pandas' vectorized string operations (`str.match()`), which is generally faster than iterative approaches for large DataFrames. The time complexity is largely determined by the regex matching process and the size of the input column. Space complexity is linear with the size of the input column.\n\n**3. Edge Case Handling:**\n    * **Missing Data:** The function correctly handles missing columns by raising a `ValueError`, which is appropriate.  `NaN` values are handled by `.fillna(False)`.\n    * **Extreme Values:**  Extremely long email addresses or those with unusual characters might still cause issues, but this is inherent to regex-based email validation.\n    * **Potential Errors:** The function now includes robust error handling for various scenarios:\n        * `TypeError` for invalid DataFrame or column name types.\n        * `ValueError` for non-existent columns.\n        * A `try-except` block to catch `KeyError`, `AttributeError`, and `TypeError` during the core email validation process.  This is excellent for gracefully handling unexpected issues during type conversion or column access.\n\n**4. Readability & Maintainability:** The code is well-structured, easy to understand, and well-commented.  Variable names are descriptive. The error handling is clearly organized, making the code easy to maintain.\n\n**5. Scalability:** The vectorized operations in pandas ensure good scalability for large datasets.  Memory usage is efficient.\n\n**6. Security & Robustness:** The function is robust due to the comprehensive error handling. No obvious security vulnerabilities exist.  The input validation prevents common errors.\n\n**7. Generalizability:** The function is highly generalizable to different datasets, provided the target column contains string data (or data that can be reasonably converted to strings).\n\n**8. Data Handling & Type Safety:** The function performs excellent data type validation with checks for `df` and `column_name` types.  The `astype(str)` conversion handles various input data types gracefully within the `try-except` block.\n\n**9. Error Handling:** The error handling is a major strength.  The function raises appropriate exceptions for invalid inputs and uses a `try-except` block to catch runtime errors, providing informative messages and returning an empty Series in case of failure.\n\n**10. Output Consistency:** The function consistently returns a pandas Series of boolean values, or an empty Series in case of an error, ensuring predictable output.\n\n\n**Domain-Specific Considerations:**\n\n* **Numerical Data:**  The function is unsuitable for numerical data and will return mostly `False` values.\n\n* **Categorical & Text Data:** Works well for categorical columns containing text resembling email addresses.\n\n* **Date & Time Data:** Not applicable; it will return mostly `False` for date/time data.\n\n* **Geographical Data:** Not applicable.\n\n\n**Final Score:**\n\n```json\n{\"score\": 9}\n```\n\nThis function is very well-implemented.  The comprehensive error handling and input validation make it robust and reliable. While the underlying email validation relies on a regex (which has inherent limitations), the overall design and implementation are excellent.  A minor improvement could be to use a more sophisticated email validation library for improved accuracy if that's a critical requirement.",
      "score": 9,
      "optimize_prompt": "\n**Task:** Improve the following function based on the provided feedback.  \n\n#### **Feedback:**  \n## Evaluation of the Improved `is_email` Function\n\nThe improved `is_email` function shows significant enhancements in error handling and clarity compared to the previous version. Here's a detailed evaluation:\n\n**1. Correctness:** The function's core logic remains the same: using a regular expression to identify email-like strings.  The correctness still depends on the regex's comprehensiveness. While the regex is improved, it's not a perfect validator for all edge cases of valid email addresses.  It's a good balance between accuracy and performance.\n\n\n**2. Efficiency:** The function is efficient. It leverages pandas' vectorized operations (`str.match()`), avoiding explicit loops.  Time complexity is largely dependent on the regex engine and the size of the input column. Space complexity remains linear.\n\n\n**3. Edge Case Handling:**\n    * **Missing Data:**  The function correctly handles missing columns by returning an empty Series.  `NaN` values are explicitly handled using `.fillna(False)`.\n    * **Extreme Values:** Extremely long email addresses might still cause issues with the regex, but this is a limitation of regex-based email validation in general.\n    * **Potential Errors:** The function now includes a `TypeError` check for the input DataFrame, significantly improving robustness.  It gracefully handles cases where the column doesn't exist.\n\n\n**4. Readability & Maintainability:** The code is well-structured, easy to read, and well-commented. Variable names are descriptive.\n\n\n**5. Scalability:** The use of pandas' vectorized operations ensures good scalability for large datasets.  Memory usage is efficient because it avoids unnecessary intermediate data structures.\n\n\n**6. Security & Robustness:** No security vulnerabilities are apparent. The `TypeError` check adds to the function's robustness.\n\n\n**7. Generalizability:** The function is generalizable to different datasets as long as the target column can be converted to strings.\n\n\n**8. Data Handling & Type Safety:** The explicit `astype(str)` conversion and the `TypeError` check demonstrate good data handling and type safety.  The `fillna(False)` ensures consistent boolean output.\n\n\n**9. Error Handling:** The addition of the `TypeError` check for the DataFrame is a significant improvement in error handling.  However,  consider adding more specific error handling for other potential issues (e.g., invalid column names that are not strings) to make it even more robust.\n\n\n**10. Output Consistency:** The function consistently returns a pandas Series of boolean values, ensuring predictable output.\n\n\n**Domain-Specific Considerations:**\n\n* **Numerical Data:** The function is still not suitable for numerical data; it will return mostly `False` values.\n\n* **Categorical & Text Data:** Works well for categorical columns containing text that resembles email addresses.\n\n* **Date & Time Data:**  Not applicable; it will return mostly `False` for date/time data.\n\n* **Geographical Data:** Not applicable.\n\n\n**Final Score:**\n\n```json\n{\"score\": 8}\n```\n\nThe improved function is well-structured, efficient, and handles many edge cases effectively. The addition of the `TypeError` check is a valuable improvement.  Adding a few more specific error checks and perhaps a more robust email validation library (if absolute accuracy is critical) could push the score even higher.  \n\n#### **Function:**  \n```python  \n```python\nimport re\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef is_email(df, column_name):\n    \"\"\"\n    Validates if values in a specified DataFrame column are valid email addresses.\n\n    Args:\n        df: The input pandas DataFrame.\n        column_name: The name of the column to validate.\n\n    Returns:\n        A pandas Series of boolean values indicating whether each value in the \n        specified column is a valid email address.

      "evaluation_response": "## Evaluation of the Improved `is_link` Function\n\nThe revised `is_link` function shows significant improvements in efficiency and robustness compared to the original version. Let's evaluate it based on the provided criteria:\n\n**1. Correctness:** The function is more correct than the previous version because it uses `urlparse` for the core URL validation. This is generally more reliable than a regular expression alone for handling the diverse syntax of valid URLs.  It correctly identifies `http` and `https` URLs with a valid netloc.  However, it still might not catch *all* edge cases of valid URLs, as `urlparse` itself has limitations.\n\n**2. Efficiency:** The use of vectorized operations (`apply` with `urlparse` and then another `apply` for the validation check) is a substantial improvement. While still using `apply`, it's far more efficient than the previous nested function approach for larger DataFrames. The time complexity is significantly reduced compared to the original, though it's still not perfectly vectorized (ideal would be a single vectorized operation).\n\n**3. Edge Case Handling:**\n    - **Empty Series:** Handled correctly.\n    - **Missing Column:** Handled correctly.\n    - **Non-string columns:** Handled correctly by returning a Series of `False` values.\n    - **Errors during parsing:** The `try...except` block catches errors, although a more specific exception handling would be better.  The current implementation is acceptable, given the implicit error handling within `urlparse`.\n\n\n**4. Readability & Maintainability:** The code is well-structured and readable. Variable names are meaningful, and comments clearly explain the logic.\n\n**5. Scalability:** The improved vectorization significantly enhances scalability. While `apply` isn't fully vectorized, it's a much more efficient approach than the previous version for large datasets, and is suitable for most practical use cases. For truly massive datasets, exploring other more advanced techniques (like using a specialized library for URL validation that's optimized for performance at scale) might be beneficial.\n\n\n**6. Security & Robustness:** No inherent security vulnerabilities are present. The function's robustness is improved by the explicit type checking and error handling.\n\n\n**7. Generalizability:** The function remains highly generalizable, applicable to various DataFrames with potential URL columns.\n\n**8. Data Handling & Type Safety:** The explicit type check (`pd.api.types.is_string_dtype`) is a significant improvement, ensuring the function handles non-string columns appropriately.\n\n**9. Error Handling:** The `try...except` block is present, but catching a more specific exception than `Exception` would be better practice (e.g., `TypeError`, `AttributeError`).  However, the current approach is acceptable in this specific context.\n\n**10. Output Consistency:** The function consistently returns a Pandas Series of boolean values, maintaining output consistency.\n\n\n**Domain-Specific Considerations:**\n\n- **Numerical Data:** Handled correctly; it returns `False` for all values in a numerical column.\n- **Categorical & Text Data:** Handles categorical data correctly if the categories are strings that might represent URLs.\n- **Date & Time Data:**  Not designed for date/time data; will return `False` for those columns.\n- **Geographical Data:** Not designed for geographical data.\n\n\n**Final Score:**\n\nThe revised function is a substantial improvement over the original. It's efficient, robust, and handles edge cases effectively. While minor improvements (like more specific exception handling) are possible, the current implementation is well-suited for many real-world scenarios.\n\n```json\n{\"score\": 9}\n```",
      "score": 9,
      "optimize_prompt": "\n**Task:** Improve the following function based on the provided feedback.  \n\n#### **Feedback:**  \n## Evaluation of the `is_link` Function\n\nThe `is_link` function aims to identify valid URLs within a Pandas DataFrame column. Let's evaluate it based on the provided criteria:\n\n**1. Correctness:** The function largely works correctly. It uses `urllib.parse.urlparse` and a regular expression to validate URLs.  However, the regex is quite restrictive and might incorrectly flag some valid URLs as invalid (e.g., those with unusual characters or longer domain names). The `all([result.scheme in [\"http\", \"https\"], result.netloc])` part is good for basic scheme and domain check, but the regex could be improved for better accuracy.\n\n**2. Efficiency:** The function's efficiency is reasonable for moderately sized DataFrames. Using `.apply()` with a custom function is generally efficient for Pandas Series operations.  The use of vectorized operations would be even faster, but may require a more complex regex or a different approach.\n\n**3. Edge Case Handling:** The function handles several edge cases well:\n    - **Empty Series:** It correctly returns an empty Series if the column is empty.\n    - **Missing Column:** It gracefully handles `KeyError` exceptions for missing columns.\n    - **Errors during parsing:** The `try-except` block catches errors during URL parsing.\n\nHowever, it could be improved by handling cases where the column contains non-string values (it might throw an error), and providing more specific error messages.\n\n**4. Readability & Maintainability:** The code is reasonably well-structured and readable.  The use of a nested function (`validate_url`) improves organization.  Comments are helpful, and variable names are meaningful.\n\n**5. Scalability:** The `.apply()` method might become a bottleneck for extremely large datasets. For massive datasets, consider using more optimized vectorized methods or potentially specialized libraries for URL validation.\n\n**6. Security & Robustness:** The function itself doesn't introduce security vulnerabilities.  However, the input DataFrame might contain malicious data.  Sanitizing input (e.g., escaping special characters) is not implemented and would be a good addition for robustness.\n\n\n**7. Generalizability:** The function is quite generalizable. It can be applied to any Pandas DataFrame with a column containing potential URLs.\n\n**8. Data Handling & Type Safety:** The function primarily handles string data. It doesn't explicitly check the data type of the input column, which is a minor weakness.  Adding a type check (e.g., `isinstance(series.iloc[0], str)`) would enhance robustness.  It implicitly handles empty strings and non-string inputs by causing the `validate_url` function to return `False`.\n\n\n**9. Error Handling:** The `try-except` blocks are well-placed and catch potential errors. However, the generic `except Exception` is too broad; it's better to catch specific exceptions for better debugging and error handling.\n\n\n**10. Output Consistency:** The function consistently returns a Pandas Series of boolean values, which is consistent and well-defined.\n\n**Domain-Specific Considerations:**\n\n- **Numerical Data:** The function is not designed for numerical data. Applying it to a numerical column would result in `False` for all values.\n- **Categorical & Text Data:** The function is primarily designed for text data (URLs). It can handle categorical data if the categories represent URLs.\n- **Date & Time Data:** The function is not designed for date and time data.  Applying it to such a column will result in `False` values.\n- **Geographical Data:** The function is not designed for geographical data.\n\n**Final Score:**\n\nThe function is functional and handles several edge cases, but it has room for improvement in terms of regex accuracy, scalability for very large datasets, and more robust error handling and input validation.\n\n```json\n{\"score\": 7}\n```  \n\n#### **Function:**  \n```python  \n```python\nimport re\nfrom urllib.parse import urlparse\n\ndef is_link(df, column_name):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if values in a specified dataframe column are valid URLs/hyperlinks.\n\n    Args:\n        df: The input pandas DataFrame.\n        column_name: The name of the column to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        A pandas Series of boolean values indicating whether each value in the \n        specified column is a valid URL.

Edge Case Handling:** The function excels in edge case handling:\n    * **Empty DataFrame:** Correctly returns `False`.\n    * **Empty Column:** Correctly returns `False`.\n    * **Missing Column:** Correctly returns `False`.\n    * **Non-string Columns (Numeric):** Explicitly handles numeric columns correctly.\n    * **Non-string Columns (Other):** Attempts conversion to string and gracefully handles failure.\n    * **Delimiter within a single value:** Correctly handles cases like \"1,000\".\n    * **Inconsistent delimiter usage:** The `is_consistent` check effectively identifies cases where some values have delimiters and others don't, ensuring that only true multi-select columns are identified.\n\n\n**4. Readability & Maintainability:** The code is well-structured, clean, and easy to understand. Variable names are descriptive, and comments effectively explain the logic.  The addition of the `delimiter` parameter enhances generalizability.\n\n**5. Scalability:** The vectorized operations in pandas ensure good scalability.  For extremely large datasets, chunking might be considered (processing the DataFrame in smaller parts), but the current implementation should handle many real-world datasets efficiently.\n\n**6. Security & Robustness:** No apparent security vulnerabilities.  The function operates only on the provided DataFrame and column name, reducing the risk of injection attacks or unexpected behavior.\n\n**7. Generalizability:** The function is highly generalizable. The `delimiter` parameter allows it to work with different separators.  It's adaptable to various data scenarios.\n\n**8. Data Handling & Type Safety:** The function demonstrates significantly improved data handling and type safety.  It explicitly checks for numeric types and attempts a safe conversion to strings, improving robustness.\n\n**9. Error Handling:** The `try-except` block within the type conversion section provides good error handling, preventing unexpected crashes.\n\n**10. Output Consistency:** The function consistently returns a boolean value (`True` or `False`), as expected.\n\n\n**Domain-Specific Considerations:**\n\n* **Numerical Data:** Handled correctly; numeric columns are explicitly excluded.\n* **Categorical & Text Data:** Handled well; the function's core purpose is for this data type.\n* **Date & Time Data:**  The function would treat date and time data as strings if they are represented as strings.  While it doesn't perform specific date/time analysis, it handles them correctly in the context of string-based delimiter detection.  If date/time values are formatted with commas (unusual), it might misinterpret them.\n* **Geographical Data:** Not directly handled; geographical data would be treated as strings, and the function would focus on the presence of the delimiter.\n\n\n**Final Score:**\n\nThe improved function demonstrates a substantial improvement in correctness, robustness, and data handling.  The efficiency and scalability are also well-maintained.  I would give it a score of **9/10**.  A perfect score (10/10) might require even more advanced handling of exceptionally large datasets or extremely unusual data formats, but for most practical applications, this function is excellent.\n\n```json\n{\"score\": 9}\n```",

      "optimize_prompt": "\n**Task:** Improve the following function based on the provided feedback.  \n\n#### **Feedback:**  \n## Evaluation of `is_multi_picklist` Function\n\nHere's a detailed evaluation of the provided Python function based on the specified criteria:\n\n**1. Correctness:** The function generally works correctly for its intended purpose. It accurately identifies columns that appear to represent multi-select picklists based on the presence of commas as delimiters.  However, its accuracy depends heavily on the consistent use of commas as separators and the absence of commas within single selections.  A more robust solution might involve checking the data types of the split elements (e.g., ensuring they are all numbers if the picklist values are expected to be numeric).\n\n**2. Efficiency:** The function is reasonably efficient for moderately sized DataFrames. The use of pandas' vectorized operations (`str.contains`, `.any()`) avoids explicit looping, which is crucial for performance.  The time complexity is roughly O(n*m), where n is the number of rows and m is the average length of the strings in the column.  Space complexity is relatively low as it primarily uses in-memory pandas structures.\n\n**3. Edge Case Handling:** The function handles several edge cases well:\n    * **Empty DataFrame:** It correctly returns `False` for an empty DataFrame.\n    * **Empty Column:** It handles columns with all `NaN` values appropriately.\n    * **Missing Column:** It returns `False` if the specified column doesn't exist.\n    * **Non-string Columns:** It implicitly handles non-string columns by returning `False` (as they cannot be multi-select picklists formatted with commas).\n\nHowever, it could be improved by explicitly handling cases where the delimiter itself might be part of a single selection (e.g., a value like \"1,000\").\n\n**4. Readability & Maintainability:** The code is well-structured and readable. Variable names are meaningful, and comments adequately explain the logic.\n\n**5. Scalability:**  The use of pandas vectorization makes the function relatively scalable.  However, for extremely large datasets, further optimization might be needed (e.g., using Dask for distributed computing if memory becomes a constraint).\n\n**6. Security & Robustness:** There are no apparent security vulnerabilities. The function operates solely on the input DataFrame and column name; there's no external data interaction that could introduce risks.\n\n**7. Generalizability:** The function is quite generalizable.  It could be adapted to handle different delimiters by modifying the `','` in the `str.contains` and `split` operations.  \n\n**8. Data Handling & Type Safety:** The function correctly checks the data type of the column using `dtype`.  However, it doesn't enforce strict type checking beyond that; it assumes that if the data type is `object` (often representing strings in pandas), it's safe to use string operations.  More robust type validation (e.g., checking for consistency in the types of values after splitting) would improve this aspect.\n\n**9. Error Handling:** The function doesn't use explicit `try-except` blocks.  Given the nature of the operations, the risk of exceptions is relatively low (unless the DataFrame is unexpectedly malformed), so this is not a major concern.\n\n**10. Output Consistency:** The function consistently returns a boolean value (`True` or `False`), making its output predictable and easy to use.\n\n**Domain-Specific Considerations:**\n\n* **Numerical Data:** The function is *not* designed for numerical data.  It implicitly relies on string-based operations (comma detection).  A numerical column would incorrectly be identified as a multi-select picklist if it contains values like \"1,234\".\n* **Categorical & Text Data:** The function is primarily designed for categorical and text data, specifically those representing multi-select values.\n* **Date & Time Data:** The function is not designed for date and time data.  It would not correctly handle such data, even if the values were represented as strings.\n* **Geographical Data:**  The function is not relevant for geographical data.\n\n\n**Final Score:**\n\nConsidering the strengths and limitations, I would give the function a score of **7/10**.  It's functional, reasonably efficient, and well-written, but it could benefit from more robust handling of edge cases (especially those involving the delimiter) and more explicit type validation to improve its correctness and generalizability.  The lack of explicit error handling is not a major drawback in this case.\n```json\n{\"score\": 7}\n```  \n\n#### **Function:**  \n```python  \n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef is_multi_picklist(df: pd.DataFrame, column_name: str) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Verifies if a given column in a DataFrame represents a multi-select picklist.\n\n    Args:\n        df: The input Pandas DataFrame.\n        column_name: The name of the column to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        True if the column represents a multi-select picklist, False otherwise.

      "evaluation_response": "## Evaluation of `is_country` Function\n\nHere's a detailed evaluation of the improved `is_country` function:\n\n**1. Correctness:** The function's correctness significantly improves by using the `pycountry` library. It now checks against a much more comprehensive list of country names and codes (including variations in capitalization).  The fallback to a smaller, hardcoded set if `pycountry` isn't installed ensures that the function still works, albeit with reduced accuracy.\n\n**2. Efficiency:** The use of `isin()` is highly efficient for this task, providing a vectorized operation that avoids slow Python loops. The time complexity is largely determined by the size of the `countries` set and the length of the DataFrame column, but it's significantly more efficient than the original `apply()` method, especially for large datasets. Space complexity is dominated by the size of the `countries` set.\n\n**3. Edge Case Handling:** The function excels in edge case handling. It explicitly checks for `None` or empty DataFrames, missing columns, and handles the potential `ImportError` if `pycountry` is not installed. The conversion to string (`astype(str)`) gracefully handles mixed data types within the column.\n\n**4. Readability & Maintainability:** The code is well-structured, easy to understand, and well-commented. The use of `pycountry` enhances maintainability as it removes the need for manual updates to the country list. The `try-except` block for the import is a good defensive programming practice.\n\n**5. Scalability:** The vectorized approach using `isin()` makes the function highly scalable. It avoids the performance bottleneck of `apply()` and handles large datasets efficiently.\n\n**6. Security & Robustness:** The function is robust and secure. There are no obvious security vulnerabilities. The error handling prevents crashes due to missing dependencies or invalid inputs.\n\n**7. Generalizability:**  The function is highly generalizable. It works with different column names and data types (after string conversion). The reliance on `pycountry` makes it adaptable to changes in country names or codes without manual updates to the code.\n\n**8. Data Handling & Type Safety:** The function handles various data types within the column by converting them to strings. It explicitly checks for `None` or empty DataFrames and missing columns.\n\n**9. Error Handling:** The `try-except` block for the `pycountry` import is excellent error handling. It provides a fallback mechanism and informs the user about the missing dependency.  Additional checks for `df` being `None` or empty are also present.\n\n**10. Output Consistency:** The function consistently returns a Pandas Series of boolean values, regardless of input size or data type within the column.\n\n\n\n**Domain-Specific Considerations:**\n\n* **Numerical Data:** The function will treat numerical data as strings, potentially leading to false negatives if a numerical value happens to match a country code in string form.  This behavior is consistent with how it handles other data types, but it's important to be aware of this limitation.\n\n* **Categorical & Text Data:** The function is ideally suited for categorical and text data representing country names or codes.\n\n* **Date & Time Data:**  The function will treat date and time data as strings. This will likely lead to incorrect results as dates/times won't match country names or codes.\n\n* **Geographical Data:** The function directly addresses a specific aspect of geographical data (country identification). It does not handle other geographical elements (city, state, coordinates, etc.).\n\n\n**Final Score:**\n\n```json\n{\"score\": 9}\n```\n\nThe improved function demonstrates excellent performance, scalability, and error handling.  The use of `pycountry` is a significant enhancement. A minor improvement could be adding a check for the type of `column_name` to ensure it's a string.  The handling of numerical data as strings, while consistent, could be considered a minor limitation.",

      "optimize_prompt": "\n**Task:** Improve the following function based on the provided feedback.  \n\n#### **Feedback:**  \n## Evaluation of `is_country` Function\n\nHere's a detailed evaluation of the provided Python function based on the given criteria:\n\n**1. Correctness:** The function correctly identifies whether a string value represents a country name or code from the predefined `countries` set.  However, the correctness is limited by the incompleteness of the `countries` set.  Adding more countries (ideally from a comprehensive, regularly updated source) would improve correctness.\n\n**2. Efficiency:** The use of a set (`countries`) for lookups is efficient (O(1) on average). Converting the column to uppercase and using `.apply()` with a lambda function is reasonably efficient for smaller to medium-sized DataFrames. For extremely large datasets, a vectorized approach (avoiding `.apply()`) might offer better performance.\n\n**3. Edge Case Handling:** The function handles missing data (`pd.notna()`) well. It also implicitly handles various data types by converting to strings (`astype(str)`).  It gracefully handles the case where the specified column doesn't exist.\n\n**4. Readability & Maintainability:** The code is well-structured and readable. Variable names are meaningful. Comments explain the purpose and functionality effectively. The use of a separate `countries` set improves maintainability, making it easier to add or update country data.\n\n**5. Scalability:** As mentioned earlier, while the current implementation is acceptable for moderate-sized datasets, for very large datasets, a vectorized approach using pandas' built-in string operations would be more scalable.  The `.apply()` method can become a bottleneck with massive DataFrames.\n\n**6. Security & Robustness:** There are no apparent security vulnerabilities. The function doesn't interact with external resources or user inputs in a way that could introduce vulnerabilities.\n\n**7. Generalizability:** The function is reasonably generalizable.  It can be applied to different datasets with a different column name.  However, the limitation lies in the hardcoded `countries` set; expanding this set (or using an external data source) would greatly enhance generalizability.\n\n**8. Data Handling & Type Safety:** The function handles various data types well by converting to strings.  It explicitly checks for missing values.  The type conversion ensures type safety to a degree.\n\n**9. Error Handling:**  The function includes a check for the existence of the column, preventing errors if the column is not found.  More robust error handling might include checking the DataFrame itself for `None` or empty input.\n\n**10. Output Consistency:** The function consistently returns a Pandas Series of boolean values, ensuring consistent output format and type.\n\n\n**Domain-Specific Considerations:**\n\n* **Numerical Data:** The function is *not* designed for numerical data.  Attempting to use it on a numerical column would lead to incorrect results (unless the numerical values coincidentally match a country code in the `countries` set).\n\n* **Categorical & Text Data:** The function is well-suited for categorical and text data representing country names or codes.\n\n* **Date & Time Data:** The function is not designed for date and time data.  Applying it to such columns would produce meaningless results.\n\n* **Geographical Data:** The function can handle country names/codes, which is a subset of geographical data.  However, it doesn't handle other geographical elements (city, state, coordinates, etc.).\n\n\n**Final Score:**\n\n```json\n{\"score\": 8}\n```\n\nThe function is well-implemented and handles many edge cases effectively.  The main areas for improvement are scalability (for very large datasets) and expanding the `countries` set for better accuracy and generalizability.

      "evaluation_response": "## Evaluation of the `is_country` function\n\nHere's a detailed evaluation of the provided Python function:\n\n**1. Correctness:** The function is largely correct. It accurately identifies countries based on name and ISO codes when `pycountry` is available. The fallback mechanism is improved, but still limited.  It correctly handles cases where the column is missing or empty.\n\n**2. Efficiency:** The function is efficient.  The use of `isin()` for vectorized lookup is a significant improvement.  The creation of the `countries` set is done only once, improving performance for multiple calls with the same `pycountry` data.\n\n**3. Edge Case Handling:**  The function handles many edge cases well:\n    * **Missing column:** Returns an empty Series.\n    * **Empty column:** Returns an empty Series.\n    * **`pycountry` missing:** Falls back to a smaller list with a warning.\n    * **Invalid data types:** Raises a `ValueError` if non-string values (excluding NaN) are present after type conversion.  This is a good addition.\n\n**4. Readability & Maintainability:** The code is well-structured and readable.  Meaningful variable names and comments are used.  Error handling is explicit and clear.\n\n**5. Scalability:** The function scales well due to the vectorized operations (`isin()`, `.astype(str)`, `.str.lower()`).  It avoids explicit loops, making it suitable for large datasets.\n\n**6. Security & Robustness:** The function is robust. Input validation prevents type errors. There are no obvious security vulnerabilities.\n\n**7. Generalizability:** The function is easily adaptable to different datasets.  It can handle various data formats in the specified column as long as they can be converted to strings.\n\n**8. Data Handling & Type Safety:** The function performs type checking for inputs and raises appropriate exceptions. The explicit check for non-string values after conversion improves type safety.  However, datetimes are still converted to strings, which might not always be ideal.\n\n**9. Error Handling:** The `try-except` block for `pycountry` and the `ValueError` for non-string data are well-implemented.  More specific error handling within the `pycountry` section (e.g., for invalid country codes) could enhance robustness further.\n\n**10. Output Consistency:** The function consistently returns a Pandas Series of boolean values.\n\n\n**Domain-Specific Considerations:**\n\n* **Numerical Data:** Numerical data is converted to strings which can lead to false positives (e.g., \"1\" might match part of \"Albania\").  The function should explicitly handle or reject numerical columns.\n* **Categorical & Text Data:**  The function works well for categorical and text data representing country names or codes.\n* **Date & Time Data:** Date and time data are converted to strings, which is not ideal.  It could lead to false negatives or positives depending on the date/time format.  Handling these data types differently should be considered.\n\n\n**Final Score:**\n\n```json\n{\"score\": 9}\n```\n\nThe function is well-written, efficient, and robust. The improvements in error handling and type safety are significant.  Minor enhancements could be made to handle numerical and datetime data more gracefully.  Adding more comprehensive error handling within the `pycountry` block would further improve the robustness.",
      "score": 9,
      "optimize_prompt": "\n**Task:** Improve the following function based on the provided feedback.  \n\n#### **Feedback:**  \n## Evaluation of the `is_country` function\n\nHere's a detailed evaluation of the provided Python function based on the given criteria:\n\n**1. Correctness:** The function generally works correctly for identifying country names and common codes (ISO 3166 alpha-2 and alpha-3).  The use of `pycountry` significantly improves accuracy. However, it relies on the `pycountry` library being installed, and its fallback mechanism is quite limited.  It might miss less common country names or variations in spelling.\n\n**2. Efficiency:** The function is reasonably efficient. Using a set (`countries`) for lookup provides O(1) average-case time complexity for checking if a value is a country. The `astype(str).str.lower()` operations are efficient for string conversions.  The fallback mechanism, while less accurate, is also efficient.\n\n**3. Edge Case Handling:** The function handles several edge cases well:\n    * **Missing column:** Returns an empty Series if the specified column doesn't exist.\n    * **Empty column:** Returns an empty Series if the column is empty.\n    * **Data types:**  It converts the column to strings (`astype(str)`), handling various input types (though datetimes will be converted to string representations).\n    * **`pycountry` not installed:** It gracefully falls back to a smaller list, with a warning.\n\n**4. Readability & Maintainability:** The code is well-structured and readable.  Variable names are meaningful, and comments explain the purpose of different sections.  The use of a `try-except` block for `pycountry` import improves maintainability.\n\n**5. Scalability:**  The use of a set for country lookups ensures good scalability. The time complexity remains relatively low even with large datasets.\n\n**6. Security & Robustness:** The function is relatively secure. There are no obvious security vulnerabilities.  Input validation prevents common errors.\n\n**7. Generalizability:** The function is generalizable to different datasets. As long as a column contains country names or codes (even with some inconsistencies), it will provide a reasonable result.\n\n**8. Data Handling & Type Safety:** The function handles various data types by converting them to strings.  It explicitly checks the data types of the inputs (`df` and `column_name`) and raises `TypeError` if they are invalid.  However, implicit conversion to string may lose information in some cases (e.g., datetime objects).\n\n**9. Error Handling:**  The `try-except` block for the `pycountry` import is a good example of error handling.  However, additional error handling might be beneficial (e.g., handling potential errors during `pycountry` lookup if a value is unexpectedly malformed).\n\n**10. Output Consistency:** The function consistently returns a pandas Series of boolean values, even if the input column is empty or the column name is invalid.\n\n**Domain-Specific Considerations:**\n\n* **Numerical Data:** The function is not designed for numerical data and will treat any numerical values as strings.  This might lead to false positives if numbers happen to match parts of country names.\n* **Categorical & Text Data:** The function works well with categorical and text data, especially country names and codes.\n* **Date & Time Data:** Date and time data will be converted to their string representation, potentially leading to inaccurate results.\n* **Geographical Data:** The function focuses on country identification and doesn't directly handle other geographical data like cities, states, or coordinates.\n\n\n**Final Score:**\n\n```json\n{\"score\": 8}\n```\n\nThe function is well-implemented and robust, handling many edge cases effectively.  However, improvements could be made to handle numerical and datetime data more intelligently and to expand the fallback mechanism to include more country variations.  More comprehensive error handling within the `pycountry` section would also be a beneficial addition.  \n\n#### **Function:**  \n```python  \n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef is_country(df: pd.DataFrame, column_name: str) -> pd.Series:\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if values in a DataFrame column are valid country names or codes.\n\n    Args:\n        df: The input DataFrame.\n        column_name: The name of the column to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        A pandas Series of booleans indicating whether each value is a valid country.\n        Returns an empty Series if the column is not found or is empty.

      "evaluation_response": "## Evaluation of the `is_country` Function\n\nHere's a detailed evaluation of the improved Python function:\n\n**1. Correctness:** The function's correctness is significantly improved compared to the previous version. It accurately checks if all values in the specified column are valid country names or codes (as defined in the `countries` dictionary).  The use of a dictionary for `countries` allows for faster lookups.  However, the accuracy remains dependent on the comprehensiveness of the `countries` dictionary.\n\n**2. Efficiency:** The function is efficient.  Using a dictionary for `countries` provides O(1) average-case lookup time. The `all()` function iterates through the series once, resulting in O(n) time complexity where n is the number of rows in the column.  The initial checks for column existence, type, emptiness, and null values are also efficient.  Memory usage is directly proportional to the size of the `countries` dictionary, which is relatively small compared to the size of the DataFrame.\n\n**3. Edge Case Handling:** The function effectively handles a wide range of edge cases:\n    * **Missing column:** The `KeyError` exception is caught.\n    * **Non-string column:**  The type check correctly identifies and handles non-string columns.\n    * **Empty column:**  Explicitly checks for and handles empty columns.\n    * **Null values:**  Effectively handles null values.\n    * **Case sensitivity:** Implicitly handles case-insensitivity by converting to uppercase before comparison.\n    * **Type Errors**: The `except (TypeError, AttributeError)` block catches potential type errors during series access or processing.\n\n**4. Readability & Maintainability:** The code is well-structured and highly readable. Variable names are clear, and comments effectively explain the logic.  The use of a dictionary for `countries` enhances maintainability.\n\n**5. Scalability:** The function scales well. The use of vectorized operations (Pandas functions and `all()`) avoids explicit loops, leading to efficient processing of large datasets.  The memory footprint remains relatively small because the `countries` dictionary is independent of the DataFrame size. The main scalability concern remains the size of the `countries` dictionary; for extremely large-scale applications, loading this data from a file or database would be necessary.\n\n**6. Security & Robustness:**  No apparent security vulnerabilities. The function operates solely on DataFrame data; there's no interaction with external sources that could introduce injection risks.\n\n**7. Generalizability:** The function is highly generalizable. It can be adapted to different datasets with minimal changes, provided the country names/codes are consistent with those in the `countries` dictionary.\n\n**8. Data Handling & Type Safety:** The function exhibits excellent data handling and type safety. It validates the data type of the column and handles null values and empty columns appropriately.\n\n**9. Error Handling:** The `try-except` blocks are well-implemented. They handle potential errors (column not found, type errors) gracefully, preventing unexpected crashes.\n\n**10. Output Consistency:** The function consistently returns a boolean value (`True` or `False`), ensuring output consistency.\n\n\n**Domain-Specific Considerations:**\n\n* **Numerical Data:** The function is *not* suitable for numerical data. It explicitly checks for string columns.\n\n* **Categorical & Text Data:** The function is well-suited for categorical and text data representing country names or codes.\n\n* **Date & Time Data:** The function is *not* suitable for date and time data.\n\n* **Geographical Data:**  The function is suitable only for the *country* aspect of geographical data. It cannot handle city, state, postal code, or coordinates.\n\n\n**Final Score:**\n\n```json\n{\"score\": 9}\n```\n\nThe function is very well-implemented, efficient, robust, and highly scalable for most practical scenarios. The primary area for improvement is expanding the `countries` dictionary for greater accuracy and possibly loading it from an external source for extremely large-scale applications.",
      "score": 9,
      "optimize_prompt": "\n**Task:** Improve the following function based on the provided feedback.  \n\n#### **Feedback:**  \n## Evaluation of the `is_country` Function\n\nHere's a detailed evaluation of the provided Python function based on the specified criteria:\n\n**1. Correctness:** The function correctly identifies whether a column contains only values present in its predefined `countries` list.  However, the correctness is limited by the incompleteness of the `countries` list.  A more comprehensive list (e.g., using a dedicated country data library) would significantly improve its accuracy.\n\n**2. Efficiency:** The function is reasonably efficient. Using sets (`column_values.issubset(set(countries))`) for the comparison is a good optimization, providing O(len(column_values)) time complexity on average for the subset check.  The initial type checking and null checks are also efficient.\n\n**3. Edge Case Handling:** The function handles the following edge cases well:\n    * **Missing column:**  The `KeyError` exception is caught.\n    * **Non-string column:** The type check (`pd.api.types.is_string_dtype`) correctly identifies non-string columns.\n    * **Null values:** The `isnull().any()` check effectively handles null values.\n    * **Case sensitivity**: The `str.upper()` conversion ensures case-insensitive matching.\n\nHowever, it doesn't handle empty DataFrames or columns gracefully; it should explicitly check for empty columns.\n\n**4. Readability & Maintainability:** The code is well-structured and readable.  Variable names are meaningful, and comments explain the logic effectively. The use of `try-except` blocks improves maintainability.\n\n**5. Scalability:** The function's scalability is good for moderately sized datasets.  The set-based comparison helps to maintain reasonable performance even with a large number of unique country values in the column. However, for extremely large datasets, loading a very large `countries` list into memory could become a bottleneck.  Consider loading the country list from a file or database for very large-scale applications.\n\n**6. Security & Robustness:** There are no apparent security vulnerabilities. The function operates on DataFrame data and doesn't directly interact with external sources that could introduce injection risks.\n\n**7. Generalizability:** The function is relatively generalizable.  It can be applied to different datasets with a column containing country names or codes.  However, it requires modification if the format of country names/codes in the dataset differs significantly from the `countries` list.\n\n**8. Data Handling & Type Safety:** The function correctly validates the data type of the column using `pd.api.types.is_string_dtype`.  It also explicitly checks for null values.  This shows good data handling and type safety.\n\n**9. Error Handling:**  The `try-except` blocks effectively handle `KeyError` (column not found) and `AttributeError` (problems with column type or other unexpected issues).  More specific exception handling could be added for better diagnostics, but the current handling is sufficient for basic error prevention.\n\n**10. Output Consistency:** The function consistently returns a boolean value (`True` or `False`), maintaining output consistency.\n\n\n**Domain-Specific Considerations:**\n\n* **Numerical Data:** The function is *not* suitable for numerical data.  It explicitly checks for string columns and would return `False` for numerical columns.\n\n* **Categorical & Text Data:** The function is designed for categorical (string) data representing countries. It works well for text data representing country names or codes.\n\n* **Date & Time Data:** The function is *not* suitable for date and time data.  It would return `False` for such columns.\n\n* **Geographical Data:** The function is only partially suitable for geographical data. It can handle columns containing country names or codes, but it cannot handle other geographical elements (city, state, postal code, coordinates).\n\n\n**Final Score:**\n\n```json\n{\"score\": 8}\n```\n\nThe function is well-implemented, efficient, and handles most edge cases effectively.  The main limitations are the incompleteness of the `countries` list and its unsuitability for non-string data types.  Using a more comprehensive country list and adding explicit checks for empty DataFrames/columns would make it even better.  \n\n#### **Function:**  \n```python  \n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef is_country(df: pd.DataFrame, column_name: str) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given column in a DataFrame contains valid country names or codes.\n\n    Args:\n        df: The input DataFrame.\n        column_name: The name of the column to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        True if the column contains only valid country names or codes, False otherwise.  \n        Returns False if the column doesn't exist or contains non-string values.\n\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        #Check if column exists and is of string type.

      "evaluation_response": "## Evaluation of the Vectorized URL Validation Function\n\nThis version of the `is_link` function shows significant improvements in efficiency and robustness.\n\n**1. Correctness:** The function is generally correct. It accurately identifies valid HTTP/HTTPS URLs.  The use of `urlparse` and the vectorized approach enhance accuracy and efficiency. While edge cases with highly unusual URLs might still exist, they're less likely to cause issues than in previous versions.\n\n**2. Efficiency:** This version is significantly more efficient than previous iterations. The vectorization of the URL parsing and validation steps leads to substantial performance gains, especially for large datasets. The avoidance of multiple `apply` calls is a key improvement.  The time complexity is now largely determined by the `urlparse` operation applied to the series (which is still a loop under the hood, but optimized by pandas) and the subsequent vectorized operations, which are highly efficient.  Space complexity remains relatively low.\n\n**3. Edge Case Handling:**  The function handles missing data and empty DataFrames correctly. Non-string data is efficiently filtered out. The `try-except` block catches potential errors during vectorized `urlparse`, returning a series of `False` values, which is a sensible approach.  However, logging the error and then continuing offers better debugging capabilities compared to simply returning `False`.  Consider adding more informative logging.\n\n\n**4. Readability & Maintainability:** The code is well-structured and easy to understand.  The comments are helpful, and the logic is clear.  The vectorized approach makes the code more concise and efficient.\n\n**5. Scalability:** This version is significantly more scalable than previous versions due to the vectorized operations. It should handle large datasets much more efficiently.  However, for extremely massive datasets, further optimizations (like using specialized libraries or parallel processing) might still be beneficial.\n\n**6. Security & Robustness:** No security vulnerabilities are apparent.  The function focuses solely on data validation and does not execute user-supplied code.\n\n**7. Generalizability:** The function remains specific to URL validation and would require significant modifications to handle other data types.\n\n**8. Data Handling & Type Safety:** The function effectively handles data types. The explicit check for strings ensures type safety, and non-string values are excluded.\n\n**9. Error Handling:** The error handling is improved. The `try-except` block gracefully handles errors during `urlparse`. However, a more informative error message (including the specific exception) would enhance debugging.  Consider separate handling for different exception types (`TypeError`, `ValueError`, etc.).\n\n**10. Output Consistency:** The function consistently returns a pandas Series of boolean values.\n\n\n**Domain-Specific Considerations:**\n\n* **Numerical Data:** Handled correctly; numerical data is excluded.\n* **Categorical & Text Data:** Handled correctly; non-URLs are False.\n* **Date & Time Data:** Handled correctly; date/time data is excluded.\n* **Geographical Data:** Not applicable.\n\n\n**Final Score:**\n\nThis version represents a substantial improvement. The vectorized approach significantly boosts efficiency and scalability. While minor improvements in error handling and logging could be made, the overall quality and performance are high.\n\n```json\n{\"score\": 9}\n```",

      "optimize_prompt": "\n**Task:** Improve the following function based on the provided feedback.  \n\n#### **Feedback:**  \n## Evaluation of the URL Validation Function\n\nThe `is_link` function demonstrates a solid approach to URL validation, incorporating improvements in error handling and data type management. However, there are still areas for optimization and enhancement.\n\n**1. Correctness:** The function generally produces correct results for a wide range of URLs. The use of `urlparse` enhances robustness. However, extremely complex or malformed URLs might still pose challenges, and the function's reliance on `scheme` and `netloc` being non-empty might lead to false negatives in some corner cases.\n\n**2. Efficiency:** While significantly improved over the original, the function still uses `apply` multiple times. This is not ideal for extremely large datasets. Although filtering non-strings helps, the repeated `apply` calls remain a potential bottleneck for massive DataFrames.  Vectorizing the entire process would be significantly more efficient.\n\n**3. Edge Case Handling:** The function excels in handling missing data (column not found, empty DataFrame, empty series after filtering) and non-string data. The explicit error handling within `safe_urlparse` is a significant improvement, logging errors for debugging purposes.  However, the `except Exception` is still too broad.  More specific exception handling (e.g., `TypeError`, `ValueError`) would enhance robustness and provide more informative error messages.\n\n**4. Readability & Maintainability:** The code is well-structured and easy to understand. Meaningful variable names and comments improve readability and maintainability. The `safe_urlparse` helper function enhances organization.\n\n**5. Scalability:** The function's scalability is better than the original, but still limited by the use of `apply`. For extremely large datasets, the repeated application of functions will cause performance degradation.  A more fully vectorized solution would be necessary.\n\n**6. Security & Robustness:** No apparent security vulnerabilities. The function primarily deals with data validation, and no user-supplied data is directly executed.\n\n**7. Generalizability:** The function is specific to URL validation and is not easily adaptable to other data types or tasks.\n\n**8. Data Handling & Type Safety:**  The function handles data types appropriately.  Explicit checks ensure that only strings are processed for URL validation.  Non-string data is gracefully handled.\n\n**9. Error Handling:** The error handling is improved with the `safe_urlparse` function, but the `except Exception` is too general.  More specific exceptions should be caught to provide better diagnostics and potentially handle specific error conditions differently.\n\n**10. Output Consistency:** The function consistently returns a pandas Series of boolean values, which is expected and appropriate.\n\n\n**Domain-Specific Considerations:**\n\n* **Numerical Data:** Handled correctly; numerical columns are ignored.\n* **Categorical & Text Data:** Handled correctly; non-URLs are classified as False.\n* **Date & Time Data:** Handled correctly; date/time data is ignored.\n* **Geographical Data:** Not applicable.\n\n\n**Final Score:**\n\nThe function is well-written, readable, and handles several edge cases effectively. However, the use of `apply` multiple times limits its scalability for massive datasets.  More complete vectorization and more specific exception handling would further enhance its performance and robustness.\n\n```json\n{\"score\": 7}\n```  \n\n#### **Function:**  \n```python  \n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom urllib.parse import urlparse\n\ndef is_link(df, column_name):\n    \"\"\"\n    Efficiently checks if values in a DataFrame column are valid URLs.\n\n    Args:\n        df: The input pandas DataFrame.\n        column_name: The name of the column to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        A pandas Series of booleans indicating whether each value is a valid URL.\n        Returns an empty Series if the column is not found or is empty.

      "evaluation_response": "## Evaluation of the Improved `is_link` Function\n\nThe revised `is_link` function shows significant improvement over the original version.  The use of vectorized operations addresses the major efficiency concern.\n\n**1. Correctness:**\n\nThe function's correctness depends heavily on the accuracy of the regular expression (`url_regex`). While the provided regex is a good starting point, it's not foolproof and might misclassify some edge cases as valid or invalid URLs.  A more comprehensive regex or a dedicated URL validation library might be needed for higher accuracy.\n\n**2. Efficiency:**\n\nThe use of `str.match` is a significant improvement. This vectorized operation avoids the slow `apply` method, leading to greatly enhanced performance, especially on large DataFrames.  The time complexity is now effectively linear with respect to the number of rows in the DataFrame.\n\n**3. Edge Case Handling:**\n\n* **Missing Data:**  The `fillna(False)` method correctly handles missing (NaN) values by classifying them as non-URLs.\n* **Extreme Values:** Extremely long URLs are still a potential concern, although less likely to cause crashes than before. Very long strings *could* still cause performance issues depending on the regex engine and the system resources.  \n* **Non-string data:** The function now correctly handles non-string values in the column by implicitly converting them to False via the `fillna(False)` after the `str.match` operation.\n* **Error Handling:** The function doesn't use `try-except` blocks because the `str.match` method handles errors gracefully (returning `NaN` for non-matching strings).  This is a cleaner and more efficient approach than explicit exception handling in this context.\n\n\n**4. Readability & Maintainability:**\n\nThe code is clean, concise, and well-commented.  Variable names are descriptive.\n\n**5. Scalability:**\n\nThe vectorized approach makes the function highly scalable.  It can efficiently handle large datasets without the performance degradation seen in the original version.\n\n**6. Security & Robustness:**\n\nNo security vulnerabilities are present. The function operates solely on the input DataFrame; there's no interaction with external resources that could introduce security risks.\n\n**7. Generalizability:**\n\nThe function is easily generalizable to different datasets.  Only the column name needs to be changed.\n\n**8. Data Handling & Type Safety:**\n\nThe function explicitly checks the input DataFrame's type and handles the case where the specified column doesn't exist or is empty.  It also gracefully handles non-string data.\n\n**9. Error Handling:**\n\nError handling is implicit but effective, relying on the robust error handling of Pandas' `str.match` method.\n\n**10. Output Consistency:**\n\nThe function consistently returns a Pandas Series of boolean values.\n\n\n**Domain-Specific Considerations:**\n\n* **Numerical Data:** The function will return `False` for numerical columns because the `str.match` method will return `NaN` for numbers, which is then filled with `False`.  This is consistent and predictable behavior.\n* **Categorical & Text Data:** The function works correctly for categorical columns containing URLs, returning `False` for non-URLs.\n* **Date & Time Data:**  Date and time data will be treated as strings. If the date/time strings happen to match the URL regex, they'll be incorrectly classified as URLs.  This highlights a limitation of relying solely on regex for URL validation.\n* **Geographical Data:**  The function would not correctly handle geographical data.\n\n\n**Final Score:**\n\nThe improved function is a significant improvement.  The vectorization dramatically improves efficiency and scalability.  While the regex could be refined for greater accuracy, the overall implementation is well-structured, efficient, and robust.  The handling of edge cases is also good.\n\n```json\n{\"score\": 9}\n```",

The combination of `urlparse` and the regular expression provides a reasonably robust check. However, it's not perfect;  some edge cases might still slip through, and overly strict URLs might be incorrectly flagged as invalid.\n\n**2. Efficiency:**\n\nThe use of `apply` with a custom function (`validate_url`) is not the most efficient approach for large DataFrames.  Vectorized operations using Pandas' built-in string functions would be significantly faster.  The regular expression itself is reasonably optimized, but the overall approach is not.\n\n**3.

Error Handling:**\n\nThe error handling is decent, but it could be improved by using more specific exception handling within the `try-except` block.\n\n**10. Output Consistency:**\n\nThe function consistently returns a Pandas Series of booleans, which is appropriate.\n\n\n**Domain-Specific Considerations:**\n\n* **Numerical Data:** The function is not designed for numerical data. Applying it to a numerical column would result in incorrect boolean values.\n* **Categorical & Text Data:** The function is designed for text data (specifically URLs). It works correctly for categorical columns containing URLs.  It would return `False` for categorical values that are not URLs.\n* **Date & Time Data:** The function is not designed for date and time data. It would incorrectly treat date/time strings as URLs.\n* **Geographical Data:** The function is not designed for geographical data.  It would not be able to identify or handle latitude/longitude, etc.\n\n\n**Final Score:**\n\nThe function is functional but has significant room for improvement in efficiency and could benefit from more robust error handling and more specific exception types.  The lack of vectorization significantly impacts its scalability.\n\n```json\n{\"score\": 6}\n```  \n\n#### **Function:**  \n```python  \n```python\nimport re\nfrom urllib.parse import urlparse\n\ndef is_link(df, column_name):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if values in a specified dataframe column are valid URLs/hyperlinks.\n\n    Args:\n        df: The pandas DataFrame.\n        column_name: The name of the column to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        A pandas Series of booleans indicating whether each value in the column \n        is a valid URL.

      "evaluation_response": "## Evaluation of the Improved `is_link` Function\n\nThe revised `is_link` function shows significant improvements in efficiency and robustness compared to the original version. Let's evaluate it:\n\n**1. Correctness:** The function is more correct. The use of a regular expression for URL validation is generally reliable, though it might still miss some very unusual but valid URL formats.  The improved error handling prevents crashes due to compilation errors.  However, the regex itself could be made more robust.\n\n\n**2. Efficiency:**  The use of vectorized operations (`series.str.match`) is a significant improvement over the previous `apply` method. This makes the function much more efficient for large datasets.  Time complexity is now largely dependent on the regex matching speed, which is generally quite fast. Space complexity is low as it primarily works with the input Series.\n\n**3. Edge Case Handling:** The function now handles missing values (`fillna('')`) and explicitly checks for the correct data type (`is_string_dtype`).  It returns an empty Series and prints a warning if the input column is not of string type, which is a good approach.  The error handling for regex compilation failures is also improved.  However, the regex itself could be refined to handle more edge cases of valid URLs (e.g., internationalized domain names, URLs with unusual characters).\n\n**4. Readability & Maintainability:** The code is well-structured, readable, and maintainable.  Comments are clear and concise.  Variable names are descriptive.\n\n**5. Scalability:** The vectorized approach makes the function highly scalable.  It should handle large datasets efficiently without significant performance degradation.\n\n**6. Security & Robustness:** No apparent security vulnerabilities. The function is robust due to improved error handling and data type checking.\n\n**7. Generalizability:** The function is easily generalizable to different datasets and columns.\n\n**8. Data Handling & Type Safety:** The function now explicitly checks for string data types before proceeding, enhancing type safety. The handling of missing values is also improved.\n\n**9. Error Handling:** Error handling is better; it checks for regex compilation issues and handles non-string columns appropriately.  However, it could still be improved by adding more specific exception handling (e.g., `try-except` blocks within the regex matching to catch potential issues).\n\n**10. Output Consistency:** The function consistently returns a Pandas Series of booleans, ensuring consistent output.\n\n\n**Domain-Specific Considerations:**\n\n* **Numerical Data:** The function correctly handles numerical data by explicitly checking the data type and returning an empty series with a warning. This is a significant improvement.\n\n* **Categorical & Text Data:** The function is well-suited for categorical and text data, provided the categories or text represent potential URLs.\n\n* **Date & Time Data:**  The function is not designed for date and time data and correctly handles this by returning an empty series if the data type is not string.\n\n* **Geographical Data:** The function is not applicable to geographical data.\n\n\n**Final Score:**\n\nThe improved function is significantly better than the original. The vectorization and improved error handling greatly enhance efficiency, scalability, and robustness.  The addition of data type checking makes it safer.  A few minor improvements could still be made to the regex for edge-case URL handling and add more specific exception handling within the regex matching.\n\n\n```json\n{\"score\": 9}\n```",
      "score": 9,
      "optimize_prompt": "\n**Task:** Improve the following function based on the provided feedback.  \n\n#### **Feedback:**  \n## Evaluation of the `is_link` Function\n\nThe `is_link` function aims to identify valid URLs within a Pandas DataFrame column. Let's evaluate it based on the provided criteria:\n\n**1. Correctness:** The function generally works correctly for typical URLs.  The regex and `urlparse` combination provides a robust check. However, it might produce false negatives for some edge cases of valid URLs (highly unusual formats) or false positives for cleverly disguised strings that mimic URLs but aren't actually valid.\n\n**2. Efficiency:** The use of Pandas' `apply` method with a custom function is not the most efficient way to handle this for extremely large DataFrames.  Vectorized operations would be significantly faster.  However, for reasonably sized datasets, the performance is acceptable.\n\n**3. Edge Case Handling:** The function handles `None` values gracefully. The `try-except` block catches potential errors during URL parsing.  However, it could benefit from more specific exception handling (e.g., catching `TypeError` separately from other exceptions for better debugging). The regex could be improved to handle more edge cases of valid URLs (e.g., internationalized domain names).\n\n**4. Readability & Maintainability:** The code is well-structured and readable. The comments are helpful.  Variable names are meaningful. The separation of URL validation into a separate function (`validate_url`) improves readability.\n\n**5. Scalability:** As mentioned, the `apply` method limits scalability. For very large datasets, a vectorized approach using Pandas' string functions or NumPy would be necessary for optimal performance.\n\n**6. Security & Robustness:**  No immediate security vulnerabilities are apparent.  The function doesn't directly interact with external resources, reducing risks.\n\n**7. Generalizability:** The function is quite generalizable. It can be easily adapted to different datasets by changing the `column_name` argument.\n\n**8. Data Handling & Type Safety:** The function implicitly handles various data types in the column (strings, `None`). It doesn't explicitly check for data types, which could be improved.  For instance, it might be helpful to raise a warning if a non-string type is encountered.\n\n**9. Error Handling:** The `try-except` block is a good start, but more specific exception handling would improve robustness and debugging.\n\n**10. Output Consistency:** The function consistently returns a Pandas Series of booleans, which is consistent and easily usable.\n\n\n**Domain-Specific Considerations:**\n\n* **Numerical Data:** The function is *not* designed for numerical data.  Attempting to use it on a numerical column would result in incorrect results.\n\n* **Categorical & Text Data:** The function is designed for text data (specifically, URLs within text). It works well for categorical columns where the categories are URLs.\n\n* **Date & Time Data:** The function is not applicable to date and time columns.\n\n* **Geographical Data:** The function is not applicable to geographical data.\n\n\n**Final Score:**\n\nConsidering the above evaluation, the function demonstrates good functionality but has room for improvement in efficiency and robustness, particularly for very large datasets.\n\n\n```json\n{\"score\": 7}\n```  \n\n#### **Function:**  \n```python  \n```python\nimport re\nfrom urllib.parse import urlparse\n\ndef is_link(df, column_name):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if values in a specified DataFrame column are valid URLs.\n\n    Args:\n        df: The pandas DataFrame.\n        column_name: The name of the column to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        A pandas Series of booleans indicating whether each value in the \n        specified column is a valid URL.

      "evaluation_response": "## Detailed Evaluation of `is_multi_picklist` Function\n\nThis revised function shows significant improvements over the previous version. Let's evaluate it based on the given criteria:\n\n**1. Correctness:** The function's logic is considerably improved. The use of `str.contains` with a compiled regular expression for separator detection is more efficient and accurate than the previous approach. The added condition `(separator_counts.max() > 1).any()` helps to avoid false positives from columns with incidental separators in single-value entries.  However, it's still not perfect; edge cases with unusual separators or very specific formatting might still lead to misclassification.\n\n**2. Efficiency:** The function is significantly more efficient than the original. The use of vectorized pandas operations (`str.contains`, `str.count`) avoids explicit Python loops, leading to substantial performance gains, especially on large DataFrames. The time complexity is now closer to O(n), where n is the number of rows, making it much more scalable. Space complexity remains relatively low.\n\n**3. Edge Case Handling:** The function handles empty DataFrames, all-null columns, and missing columns gracefully. The `try-except` block catches `KeyError`, `TypeError`, and `AttributeError` exceptions, preventing unexpected crashes. However, it could benefit from more specific error handling (e.g., differentiating between different types of `TypeError`) and handling cases with mixed data types within a column more robustly.\n\n**4. Readability & Maintainability:** The code is well-structured and readable.  Comments clearly explain the purpose of each section. Variable names are meaningful. The use of vectorized operations enhances readability by making the code more concise.  The `try-except` block improves maintainability by handling potential errors.\n\n**5. Scalability:** The use of vectorized pandas operations makes the function highly scalable.  It should perform well even on very large datasets because it avoids the performance bottlenecks of explicit Python loops.\n\n**6. Security & Robustness:** No apparent security vulnerabilities. The function operates solely on DataFrame data and doesn't interact with external sources. The improved error handling enhances robustness.\n\n**7. Generalizability:** The function is more generalizable than the original due to the use of regular expressions for separator detection. However, it's still limited to separators specified in the `separators` list.  Allowing users to provide custom separators or regular expressions would make it even more versatile.\n\n**8. Data Handling & Type Safety:** The function correctly validates the data type using `series.dtype != object`.  The `try-except` block helps to handle potential type errors gracefully.\n\n**9. Error Handling:** The `try-except` block is a significant improvement, catching potential errors and preventing crashes.  However, more granular error handling (e.g., logging errors instead of just printing them) would enhance debugging and monitoring.\n\n**10. Output Consistency:** The function consistently returns a boolean value (`True` or `False`), ensuring predictable output.\n\n\n**Domain-Specific Considerations:**\n\n* **Numerical Data:** The function correctly identifies numerical columns as *not* multi-select picklists because it explicitly checks for string type (`object`).\n* **Categorical & Text Data:** The function is well-suited for categorical and text data, providing a robust way to detect multi-select picklists in these data types.\n* **Date & Time Data:**  The function would still incorrectly classify date/time columns as multi-select picklists if they contain separators like '/' or '-'.  This needs to be addressed.\n* **Geographical Data:**  The function remains unsuitable for geographical data.\n\n\n**Final Score:**\n\n```json\n{\"score\": 9}\n```\n\nThe function demonstrates a significant improvement in correctness, efficiency, and robustness compared to the previous version.  The use of vectorized operations and improved error handling makes it highly scalable and suitable for large datasets.  Minor improvements in handling edge cases (especially date/time data) and more granular error handling would push it to a perfect 10.",
      "score": 9,
      "optimize_prompt": "\n**Task:** Improve the following function based on the provided feedback.  \n\n#### **Feedback:**  \n## Detailed Evaluation of `is_multi_picklist` Function\n\nHere's a detailed evaluation of the provided Python function based on the specified criteria:\n\n**1. Correctness:** The function generally works correctly for identifying columns that likely represent multi-select picklists based on the presence of separators in string data. However, it's not foolproof.  A column with incidental separators in single-value entries could be misidentified.  Conversely, a cleverly formatted multi-select column without common separators might be missed.\n\n**2. Efficiency:** The function is reasonably efficient. The use of `any` with generators avoids unnecessary iteration.  The time complexity is largely dependent on the size of the DataFrame and the length of strings within the column, making it O(n*m) in the worst case where n is the number of rows and m is the average string length. Space complexity is relatively low, dominated by the DataFrame itself.\n\n**3. Edge Case Handling:** The function handles empty DataFrames and columns with all `NaN` values correctly. It also checks for the existence of the column. However, it doesn't explicitly handle other potential edge cases, such as columns with mixed data types (numbers and strings) or unusual separators.\n\n**4. Readability & Maintainability:** The code is well-structured and reasonably readable.  Variable names are mostly meaningful. Comments explain the logic clearly. However,  more robust error handling (e.g., `try-except` blocks for potential `TypeError` exceptions if data is unexpectedly not string-like) would improve maintainability.\n\n**5. Scalability:**  The function's efficiency is decent for moderately sized datasets. For very large datasets, the string operations within the `any` could become a bottleneck.  Vectorized string operations (using pandas' built-in string methods) are generally more efficient than looping in Python.\n\n**6. Security & Robustness:** No significant security vulnerabilities are apparent. The function operates on DataFrame data and doesn't directly interact with external sources.\n\n**7. Generalizability:** The function is relatively generalizable, but its reliance on common separators limits its applicability.  A more robust solution might allow specifying custom separators or using regular expressions for more flexible pattern matching.\n\n**8. Data Handling & Type Safety:** The function explicitly checks for the data type (`object` for strings).  This is good, but it could be more robust by handling potential `TypeError` exceptions gracefully.\n\n**9. Error Handling:** The function lacks explicit error handling. Adding `try-except` blocks would enhance robustness, particularly for handling cases where the column's data type is not as expected.\n\n**10. Output Consistency:** The function consistently returns a boolean value (`True` or `False`), ensuring consistent output.\n\n\n**Domain-Specific Considerations:**\n\n* **Numerical Data:** The function is *not* designed for numerical data. It explicitly checks for string type (`object`) and relies on string operations.  It would incorrectly classify numerical columns.\n* **Categorical & Text Data:** The function is primarily designed for categorical and text data, particularly those representing multi-select picklists.  It's suitable for this domain but may need adjustments for unusual separator usage.\n* **Date & Time Data:** The function is not suitable for date and time data. It would likely misinterpret date/time formats as multi-select picklists due to the presence of separators (e.g., '/', '-').\n* **Geographical Data:** The function is completely unsuitable for geographical data.  It relies on string separators and would not be able to determine if a column contains geographical information.\n\n\n**Final Score:**\n\n```json\n{\"score\": 7}\n```\n\nThe function is functional and demonstrates good coding practices in some areas, but it has limitations in handling various data types and edge cases.  Improvements in error handling, generalizability, and the ability to handle diverse data types would significantly raise its score.  \n\n#### **Function:**  \n```python  \n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef is_multi_picklist(df: pd.DataFrame, column_name: str) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Verifies if a given column in a DataFrame represents a multi-select picklist.\n\n    Args:\n        df: The input Pandas DataFrame.\n        column_name: The name of the column to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        True if the column is a multi-select picklist, False otherwise.

      "evaluation_response": "## Evaluation of the `is_country` Function\n\nThis improved version of `is_country` shows significant enhancements in efficiency and error handling compared to the previous iteration. Let's analyze it based on the evaluation criteria:\n\n**1. Correctness:** The function's core logic is correct. It accurately identifies whether strings in a specified column represent countries from the `countries` set. The case-insensitive comparison (`str.lower()`) ensures robustness.  However, the accuracy is still limited by the completeness of the `countries` set; it might miss less common or newly recognized countries.\n\n**2. Efficiency:** The use of a `set` for `countries` is a significant improvement.  Set lookups (`isin`) have an average time complexity of O(1), making this version much more efficient than the previous list-based approach (O(n*m)). The vectorized operations within pandas further enhance performance.  Space complexity is O(m), where m is the number of countries, which is relatively small and constant.\n\n**3. Edge Case Handling:** The function excels in handling edge cases:\n    * **Missing column:**  Correctly returns an empty Series if `column_name` is not found.\n    * **Empty column:**  Handles empty columns (`col.empty`) gracefully, returning an empty Series.\n    * **Data type variations:** The `col.astype(str)` conversion ensures that the function works correctly even if the input column has mixed data types (e.g., numbers or dates alongside strings). This is a substantial improvement.\n    * **Errors:** The `try-except` block catches `KeyError`, `TypeError`, and `AttributeError`, preventing crashes and providing informative error messages.\n\n**4. Readability & Maintainability:** The code is well-structured and easy to understand. Comments clearly explain the purpose of different sections. Variable names are meaningful.\n\n**5. Scalability:** The use of a set and vectorized operations makes the function highly scalable.  It should handle large datasets efficiently without significant performance degradation, unlike the previous version.\n\n**6. Security & Robustness:**  No security vulnerabilities are apparent. The function is robust against various input types and potential errors.\n\n**7. Generalizability:** The function is highly generalizable. It can be easily adapted to different datasets by changing the `column_name` argument.  Adding or modifying countries in the `countries` set is straightforward.\n\n**8. Data Handling & Type Safety:** The function's handling of mixed data types via `astype(str)` is a crucial improvement. It gracefully manages various data types within the input column, enhancing type safety.\n\n**9. Error Handling:**  The `try-except` block is comprehensive and provides informative error messages, significantly improving error handling.\n\n**10. Output Consistency:** The function consistently returns a pandas Series of booleans, maintaining output consistency across different scenarios.\n\n\n**Domain-Specific Considerations:**\n\n* **Numerical Data:** The function implicitly handles numerical data by converting it to strings. If the numerical data represents country codes (e.g., ISO 3166), a separate mechanism would be needed for accurate identification.\n* **Categorical & Text Data:** The function is well-suited for categorical and text data representing country names.\n* **Date & Time Data:**  The function would not correctly interpret date and time data as country names.\n* **Geographical Data:** The function only handles country names; it doesn't process other geographical information (city, state, etc.).\n\n\n**Final Score:**\n\n```json\n{\"score\": 9}\n```\n\nThis improved version is a substantial enhancement. The use of a set for country lookup, the robust handling of data types, and the comprehensive error handling make it highly efficient, scalable, and robust. The only reason it doesn't receive a perfect 10 is the reliance on a hardcoded list of countries, which could be further improved by using an external, regularly updated database of country names and codes for higher accuracy.",
      "score": 9,
      "optimize_prompt": "\n**Task:** Improve the following function based on the provided feedback.  \n\n#### **Feedback:**  \n## Evaluation of the `is_country` function\n\nThe `is_country` function demonstrates a good approach to checking if DataFrame column values represent valid country names. Let's evaluate it based on the provided criteria:\n\n**1. Correctness:** The function correctly identifies country names from a predefined list.  It converts both the input data and the list to lowercase for case-insensitive matching, which is a good practice. However, its correctness is limited by the comprehensiveness of the `countries` list.  A more robust solution would use a regularly updated external library or dataset containing country names and codes.\n\n**2. Efficiency:** The function is reasonably efficient. Using `isin` on a pandas Series is generally performant. The pre-built list avoids repeated lookups. Time complexity is approximately O(n*m) where n is the length of the dataframe column and m is the number of countries in the list, which is relatively small and constant. Space complexity is O(m) due to the `countries` list.\n\n**3. Edge Case Handling:** The function handles several edge cases well:\n    *   Empty DataFrame or column: Returns an empty Series.\n    *   Null values: `isnull().all()` correctly handles columns with only nulls.\n    *   Empty strings: `str.strip().eq(\"\").all()` effectively handles columns with only empty strings.\n    *   Column not found: The `try-except` block catches `KeyError`.\n    *   Other errors (e.g., incorrect column type): The `try-except` block catches `AttributeError`.\n\n**4. Readability & Maintainability:** The code is well-structured and readable. The comments are helpful.  Variable names are clear.  The use of lowercase for consistent comparison enhances readability.\n\n**5. Scalability:**  The function's scalability is primarily limited by the size of the `countries` list and the `isin` operation. For extremely large datasets, using a more optimized data structure for country lookup (like a set or a Trie) could improve performance.\n\n**6. Security & Robustness:** There are no apparent security vulnerabilities. Input is handled gracefully, and the `try-except` blocks prevent crashes from unexpected inputs.\n\n**7. Generalizability:** The function is relatively generalizable. It can be applied to different datasets with minimal changes, provided the column to check contains country names or codes.  To adapt to different data formats (e.g., ISO codes), only the `countries` list would need modification.\n\n**8. Data Handling & Type Safety:** The function implicitly handles string data.  It would need modification to handle numerical or date data that might represent countries indirectly (e.g., country codes).  Explicit type checking could make the function more robust.\n\n**9. Error Handling:** The `try-except` block is effective in handling `KeyError` and `AttributeError`. More specific error handling could provide more informative messages in case of other exceptions.\n\n**10. Output Consistency:** The function consistently returns a pandas Series of booleans, even in edge cases (an empty Series if the input is invalid).\n\n**Domain-Specific Considerations:**\n\n*   **Numerical Data:** The function is not designed for numerical data.  It would require a completely different approach if numerical codes were used to represent countries.\n*   **Categorical & Text Data:** The function works well for categorical and text data representing country names.\n*   **Date & Time Data:** The function is not applicable to date and time data.\n*   **Geographical Data:**  The function only addresses the country aspect of geographical data.  It does not handle city, state, postal codes etc.\n\n\n**Final Score:**\n\n```json\n{\"score\": 8}\n```\n\nThe function is well-implemented and robust for its intended purpose (checking country names in string columns). However,  the limited country list and lack of handling for numerical or other types of country representations prevent a higher score.  Adding features like support for ISO codes and more comprehensive country data would significantly improve its capabilities.  \n\n#### **Function:**  \n```python  \n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef is_country(df: pd.DataFrame, column_name: str) -> pd.Series:\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if values in a DataFrame column are valid country names or codes.\n\n    Args:\n        df: The input DataFrame.\n        column_name: The name of the column to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        A pandas Series of booleans indicating whether each value is a valid country.\n        Returns an empty Series if the column doesn't exist or is empty.

      "evaluation_response": "## Evaluation of the `is_state` function\n\nThis revised `is_state` function shows significant improvement over the previous version. Let's evaluate it based on the provided criteria:\n\n**1. Correctness:** The function's correctness now depends on the accuracy and completeness of the external `state_provinces.csv` file.  If that file is accurate and comprehensive, the function will correctly identify whether all values in the specified column are valid state/province names.  The use of `.isin()` and vectorized operations ensures that the comparison is performed efficiently and correctly.\n\n**2. Efficiency:** The use of Pandas' vectorized operations (`isin()`, `.str.strip()`, `.str.title()`) makes this function significantly more efficient than the previous loop-based version. The time complexity is now largely determined by the `isin()` operation, which is highly optimized in Pandas.  Space complexity remains relatively low, dominated by the size of the `state_data` Series.\n\n**3. Edge Case Handling:**\n\n*   **Missing column:** Correctly handles missing columns by returning `False`.\n*   **Non-string columns:** Correctly handles non-string columns by returning `False`.\n*   **Empty DataFrame:** Handles empty DataFrames correctly.\n*   **Whitespace:** Effectively handles leading/trailing whitespace using `.str.strip()`.\n*   **File Errors:** Includes robust error handling for `FileNotFoundError` and other exceptions during CSV loading, preventing crashes and providing informative messages.\n\n**4. Readability & Maintainability:** The code is well-structured and easy to understand.  Variable names are descriptive, and comments explain the purpose of different sections.  The separation of state data loading from the core logic enhances maintainability.\n\n**5. Scalability:** The vectorized approach makes the function highly scalable. It avoids explicit looping, making it suitable for large datasets.  The performance will primarily be limited by the size of the `state_data` and the DataFrame itself, but it avoids the O(n) time complexity of the previous version.\n\n**6. Security & Robustness:** No apparent security vulnerabilities. Input validation prevents common errors, and exception handling increases robustness.\n\n**7. Generalizability:** The function is more generalizable than before.  By loading state data from a CSV, you can easily adapt it to different countries or regions by simply changing the input CSV file. This makes it much more flexible.\n\n**8. Data Handling & Type Safety:** The function effectively validates the input DataFrame and column name types. It also efficiently checks for string data types in the column using `pd.api.types.is_string_dtype()`.\n\n**9. Error Handling:**  The `try...except` blocks effectively handle potential errors during file loading, making the function more robust.\n\n**10. Output Consistency:** The function consistently returns a boolean value (`True` or `False`).\n\n\n**Domain-Specific Considerations:**\n\n*   **Numerical Data:** The function is explicitly designed for string data and will return `False` if applied to a numerical column. This is a reasonable design choice given its purpose.\n*   **Categorical & Text Data:**  It is well-suited for categorical text data, specifically state/province names.\n*   **Date & Time Data:** Not applicable.\n*   **Geographical Data:** The function addresses a specific aspect of geographical data (state/province), but it doesn't handle other geographical elements like cities or coordinates.\n\n\n**Final Score:**\n\nThe improved function demonstrates excellent design, efficiency, and robustness.  The use of vectorized operations and external data loading significantly enhances its scalability and maintainability.\n\n```json\n{\"score\": 9}\n```",

      "optimize_prompt": "\n**Task:** Improve the following function based on the provided feedback.  \n\n#### **Feedback:**  \n## Evaluation of the `is_state` function\n\nHere's a detailed evaluation of the provided Python function based on the specified criteria:\n\n**1. Correctness:** The function correctly checks if all values in a specified column are contained within the `states_provinces` list. It handles case variations by using `.title()`. However, its correctness is heavily dependent on the completeness of the `states_provinces` list.  The provided list is a small subset and would fail for many valid state/province names.  Therefore, while the logic is correct *given its limited data*, it's not correct in a general sense.\n\n**2. Efficiency:** The function iterates through each value in the column. This gives it a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of rows in the DataFrame. For large datasets, this could be slow.  Space complexity is O(1) as it uses a fixed-size list.\n\n**3. Edge Case Handling:** The function handles the following edge cases well:\n\n*   **Missing column:** It returns `False` if the specified column doesn't exist.\n*   **Non-string values:** It raises a `ValueError` if the column contains non-string values.\n*   **Empty DataFrame:** It will function correctly with an empty DataFrame (though it might be considered a minor edge case).\n*   **Whitespace:** It handles leading/trailing whitespace using `.strip()`.\n\n\nHowever, it doesn't handle potential errors related to data loading or corrupted data in a more robust manner.\n\n**4. Readability & Maintainability:** The code is well-structured, with clear variable names and comments. The use of a separate list for states/provinces improves maintainability.\n\n**5. Scalability:** The linear time complexity (O(n)) makes it less scalable for extremely large datasets.  For very large datasets, a more efficient approach using vectorized operations (e.g., Pandas' `isin()`) would be preferable.\n\n\n**6. Security & Robustness:**  There are no apparent security vulnerabilities. The input validation helps prevent crashes from unexpected input types.\n\n**7. Generalizability:** The function is relatively generalizable.  To apply it to different countries, one would only need to update the `states_provinces` list.  However, the current implementation is tightly coupled to the specific list provided.  A more robust approach would involve using an external data source (e.g., a database or API) to fetch the list of states/provinces dynamically.\n\n**8. Data Handling & Type Safety:**  The function correctly validates the input DataFrame type and column name type. It also explicitly checks for non-string values within the column.\n\n**9. Error Handling:** The `try-except` block correctly handles the `KeyError` (missing column).  However, more comprehensive error handling (e.g., for file I/O errors if loading data from a file) might be needed in a production environment.\n\n**10. Output Consistency:** The function consistently returns a boolean value (`True` or `False`).\n\n**Domain-Specific Considerations:**\n\n*   **Numerical Data:** The function is not designed for numerical data and will raise a `ValueError` if applied to a numerical column.\n*   **Categorical & Text Data:** The function is designed for categorical data (specifically, state/province names) and handles text data well (after validation).\n*   **Date & Time Data:** The function is not suitable for date and time data.\n*   **Geographical Data:**  The function focuses solely on state/province names; it doesn't handle other geographical data such as cities, countries, or coordinates.\n\n\n**Final Score:**\n\nConsidering the limitations of the small, hardcoded state/province list, the function is functional but needs improvements in scalability and generalizability to handle real-world datasets.  A score of 6 reflects its current state.\n\n\n```json\n{\"score\": 6}\n```  \n\n#### **Function:**  \n```python  \n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef is_state(df: pd.DataFrame, column_name: str) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given column in a DataFrame contains valid state/province names.\n\n    Args:\n        df: The input Pandas DataFrame.\n        column_name: The name of the column to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        True if all values in the specified column are valid state/province names \n        (case-insensitive), False otherwise.

While it handles `NaN` values according to the `nan_as_invalid` flag,  the limited scope of countries included (only US and CA) is a significant limitation.\n\n**2. Efficiency:** The function leverages pandas' vectorized operations (`isin`, `.str.lower()`, `.fillna()`), resulting in efficient processing, especially for large DataFrames. The time complexity is approximately O(n), where n is the number of rows. Space complexity is O(m), where m is the number of states/provinces in the largest country in `country_codes` (relatively small and constant).  The efficiency is very good.\n\n**3. Edge Case Handling:** The function demonstrates robust edge case handling:\n    * It correctly identifies missing columns (`column_name` not in `df.columns`).\n    * It validates the `country` code format (two-letter string).\n    * It gracefully handles potential `AttributeError` and `TypeError` exceptions from non-string columns.\n    * It manages `NaN` values based on the `nan_as_invalid` parameter.\n    * It handles unsupported countries by returning `False`.\n\n**4. Readability & Maintainability:** The code is well-structured and highly readable.  Variable names are descriptive, and comments clarify the function's purpose and logic. The use of a dictionary (`country_codes`) to store state/province lists enhances maintainability compared to hardcoded `if/elif` blocks.  The `nan_as_invalid` parameter adds flexibility.\n\n**5. Scalability:** The vectorized operations in pandas ensure excellent scalability. The function can efficiently process large datasets without significant performance degradation.  Memory usage remains efficient due to the avoidance of explicit loops.\n\n**6. Security & Robustness:** No obvious security vulnerabilities are present.  The function operates solely on the input DataFrame and doesn't interact with external systems (except potentially in a future implementation using an external API), minimizing security risks.\n\n**7. Generalizability:** The function is significantly more generalizable than earlier versions due to the `country` parameter and the use of the `country_codes` dictionary. However, its generalizability is still limited by the hardcoded country list within `country_codes`.  A dynamic data source (e.g., an API call to a geographical database) would dramatically improve generalizability.\n\n**8. Data Handling & Type Safety:** The function effectively handles various data types and potential errors. The explicit type check for `country` enhances type safety.  The handling of `NaN` values is configurable, making it flexible.\n\n**9. Error Handling:** The error handling is comprehensive, catching several potential exceptions.  The function's responses to different error conditions are consistent and predictable.\n\n**10. Output Consistency:** The function consistently returns a boolean value (`True` or `False`), maintaining output consistency.\n\n\n**Domain-Specific Considerations:**\n\n* **Numerical Data:** The function is not designed for numerical data; it explicitly works with string data representing state/province names.\n* **Categorical & Text Data:** The function is well-suited for and operates correctly on categorical (text) data.\n* **Date & Time Data:** Not applicable.\n* **Geographical Data:** The function addresses a specific aspect of geographical data (state/province names).  It could be extended to handle other geographical elements (city, postal code, etc.) by integrating with appropriate external APIs or databases.\n\n\n**Final Score:**\n\nThis function represents a substantial improvement over previous versions.  Its robust error handling, efficient use of pandas, and configurable `NaN` handling make it suitable for many real-world scenarios.  The main area for improvement is the replacement of the hardcoded `country_codes` dictionary with a dynamic data source for improved generalizability and maintainability.\n\n```json\n{\"score\": 9}\n```",

      "optimize_prompt": "\n**Task:** Improve the following function based on the provided feedback.  \n\n#### **Feedback:**  \n## Evaluation of the `is_state` Function\n\nHere's a detailed evaluation of the improved Python function:\n\n**1. Correctness:** The function's core logic is correct. It accurately checks if all values in the specified column match the provided list of valid states/provinces for the given country.  However, the correctness still depends entirely on the accuracy of the `valid_states` lists.  The limited number of countries supported (US and CA) and the hardcoded nature of the lists remain a significant limitation.\n\n**2. Efficiency:** The function uses pandas' vectorized operations (`isin`, `.str.lower()`, `.dropna()`), making it efficient for large DataFrames. The time complexity is approximately O(n), where n is the number of rows. Space complexity is O(m), where m is the number of valid states (relatively small and constant for each country).  The efficiency is good.\n\n**3. Edge Case Handling:** The function significantly improves edge case handling:\n    * It correctly handles missing columns.\n    * It uses a `try-except` block to catch `AttributeError` and `TypeError` related to the column data type.\n    * It explicitly handles NaN values by dropping them (a better approach would be to make this configurable\u2014should NaNs be considered invalid or ignored?).\n    * It handles invalid country codes.\n\n**4. Readability & Maintainability:** The code is well-structured and readable. Variable names are meaningful, and comments clearly explain the logic. The addition of the `country` parameter improves generalizability.\n\n**5. Scalability:** The use of pandas' vectorized operations ensures good scalability for large datasets. Memory usage remains manageable because it avoids explicit looping.\n\n**6. Security & Robustness:** No security vulnerabilities are present. The function operates only on the input DataFrame and doesn't interact with external systems in a way that could introduce risks.\n\n**7. Generalizability:** The function is more generalizable than the previous version due to the `country` parameter.  However, it's still limited by the hardcoded lists of states.  A more robust solution would dynamically load the state/province data from a reliable external source (an API or database) based on the provided `country` code.\n\n**8. Data Handling & Type Safety:** The function handles non-string columns and NaN values more effectively than before.  However,  more robust type validation (e.g., checking if `country` is a two-letter string) could be added for greater safety.\n\n**9. Error Handling:** The `try-except` block is improved, catching more potential errors.  However, it could be enhanced further by including more specific exception handling (e.g., handling `KeyError` if `column_name` is misspelled).\n\n\n**10. Output Consistency:** The function consistently returns a boolean value as expected.\n\n**Domain-Specific Considerations:**\n\n* **Numerical Data:**  The function is not suitable for numerical data.\n* **Categorical & Text Data:** The function is designed for and works well with categorical (text) data.\n* **Date & Time Data:** Not applicable.\n* **Geographical Data:** The function handles a specific subset of geographical data (state/province names).  It could be extended to handle other geographical data types with additional logic and data sources.\n\n\n**Final Score:**\n\nThe improved function is much better than the original.  The enhanced error handling, explicit NaN handling, and the addition of the `country` parameter are significant improvements. However, the hardcoded state lists limit its generalizability and maintainability in a production setting.  A robust external data source for state/province information would elevate this function to a higher level.\n\n```json\n{\"score\": 8}\n```  \n\n#### **Function:**  \n```python  \n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef is_state(df: pd.DataFrame, column_name: str, country: str = \"US\") -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given column in a DataFrame contains valid state/province names for a specified country.\n\n    Args:\n        df: The input DataFrame.\n        column_name: The name of the column to check.\n        country: The two-letter country code (e.g., \"US\", \"CA\").

      "evaluation_response": "## Evaluation of the `is_state` Function\n\nThis revised `is_state` function shows significant improvement over the previous version. Let's evaluate it:\n\n**1. Correctness:** The function now correctly implements its intended logic. It accurately checks if values in the specified column match valid US state names or abbreviations (either from a provided set or a default set).  The use of `.isin()` is efficient and accurate for this task.\n\n**2. Efficiency:** The function is highly efficient. It leverages vectorized pandas operations (`astype`, `.str.lower()`, `.isin()`), avoiding explicit loops.  The time complexity remains O(n), but the constant factor is low due to the efficiency of pandas' vectorized methods. Space complexity is also O(n) due to the creation of the boolean Series.\n\n**3. Edge Case Handling:** The function excels in edge case handling:\n    * It correctly handles missing values (NaN) by converting to strings.\n    * It gracefully handles empty columns by returning an empty Series.\n    * It performs robust input validation, raising `TypeError` and `ValueError` for invalid inputs (DataFrame type, column name type, `state_codes` type).\n    * It provides a default set of US state codes if `state_codes` is not provided, enhancing usability.\n\n**4. Readability & Maintainability:** The code is well-structured, clean, and easy to understand.  Variable names are descriptive, and comments clearly explain the purpose and functionality. The use of a default `state_codes` set improves maintainability.\n\n**5. Scalability:**  The vectorized nature of the pandas operations ensures excellent scalability.  It can efficiently handle very large datasets without significant performance degradation.\n\n**6. Security & Robustness:**  The function is robust and secure.  Input validation prevents common errors and potential crashes. There are no apparent security vulnerabilities.\n\n**7. Generalizability:** The function is more generalizable than the previous version.  The ability to supply a custom `state_codes` argument allows adapting it to different regions or sets of states/provinces.  However, it's still primarily focused on US states.  Significant changes would be needed to handle other countries.\n\n**8. Data Handling & Type Safety:**  Data type validation is excellent.  The function correctly handles string conversions and checks for the correct types of inputs.\n\n**9. Error Handling:**  Error handling is well-implemented using `TypeError` and `ValueError` exceptions, providing informative error messages.\n\n**10. Output Consistency:** The function consistently returns a Pandas Series of boolean values (True/False), maintaining consistency even for edge cases.\n\n\n**Domain-Specific Considerations:**\n\n* **Numerical Data:**  The function is not suitable for numerical data. Applying it to a numerical column will result in incorrect boolean values.\n* **Categorical & Text Data:** The function works well for categorical and text data representing state/province names.\n* **Date & Time Data:**  The function is not designed for date/time data.\n* **Geographical Data:** The function is suitable for geographical data specifically related to US states but would require modification for other geographic entities.\n\n\n**Final Score:**\n\nThis improved function is well-designed, efficient, robust, and handles edge cases effectively.  Its generalizability is improved by allowing a custom set of state codes.  The only limitation is its current focus on US states.\n\n```json\n{\"score\": 9}\n```",

      "optimize_prompt": "\n**Task:** Improve the following function based on the provided feedback.  \n\n#### **Feedback:**  \n## Evaluation of `is_state` Function\n\nThe `is_state` function aims to check if values in a DataFrame column represent valid state/province names. Let's evaluate it based on the provided criteria:\n\n**1. Correctness:** The function's core logic is flawed. It doesn't actually check for valid state/province names; instead, it simply checks if the values are not null (after converting to string and lowercase).  This means any non-null string will be considered \"valid,\" regardless of whether it's a real state name.  Therefore, it's incorrect in its primary purpose.\n\n**2. Efficiency:** The function is reasonably efficient for its (incorrect) task.  The use of vectorized pandas operations (`astype`, `.str.lower()`, `.notna()`) avoids explicit looping, making it relatively fast even for large DataFrames. Time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of rows. Space complexity is O(n) as well, due to creating a new Series.\n\n**3. Edge Case Handling:** The function handles missing data (NaN) correctly by converting them to strings and then checking for `notna()`. It also gracefully handles empty columns by returning an empty Series. It includes good error handling for incorrect input types (DataFrame, column name).\n\n**4. Readability & Maintainability:** The code is well-structured and readable. The docstrings are clear and informative. Variable names are meaningful.\n\n**5. Scalability:**  The vectorized pandas operations ensure good scalability.  It should handle large datasets efficiently.\n\n**6. Security & Robustness:** No apparent security vulnerabilities. Input validation is present, preventing crashes from invalid input types.\n\n**7. Generalizability:** The function is not very generalizable in its current form because its core logic (checking for non-null strings) is not specific to state/province names.  To be truly generalizable, it would need to incorporate a list or database of valid state/province names for comparison.\n\n**8. Data Handling & Type Safety:** The function handles various data types (after converting to string) and missing values well.  Type checking for the input DataFrame and column name is also implemented correctly.\n\n**9. Error Handling:**  Appropriate `TypeError` and `ValueError` exceptions are raised for invalid inputs.\n\n**10. Output Consistency:** The function consistently returns a Pandas Series of boolean values, even for edge cases (empty column).\n\n\n**Domain-Specific Considerations:**\n\n* **Numerical Data:** The function is not suitable for numerical data.  Its logic is based on string comparisons, and applying it to a numerical column would yield meaningless results.\n* **Categorical & Text Data:** The function *can* be applied to categorical and text data, but only to check for non-missing values, not for the validity of the categorical values themselves (as mentioned above regarding state names).\n* **Date & Time Data:** The function is not designed for date and time data. Applying it would lead to incorrect results.\n* **Geographical Data:**  The function is unsuitable for validating geographical data (cities, states, countries, etc.) without modification. It would need a database of geographical entities for proper validation.\n\n\n**Final Score:**\n\nThe function has good structure, error handling, and readability. However, its core logic is fundamentally flawed, making it largely incorrect for its intended purpose.  While efficient for its (incorrect) task, its lack of accurate state/province validation severely limits its usefulness.\n\n```json\n{\"score\": 4}\n```  \n\n#### **Function:**  \n```python  \n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef is_state(df: pd.DataFrame, column_name: str) -> pd.Series:\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if values in a specified DataFrame column are valid state/province names.\n\n    Args:\n        df: The input Pandas DataFrame.\n        column_name: The name of the column containing state/province names.\n\n    Returns:\n        A Pandas Series of boolean values indicating whether each value \n        in the specified column is a valid state/province name.

      "evaluation_response": "## Evaluation of `is_pincode` Function\n\nHere's a detailed evaluation of the latest `is_pincode` function:\n\n**1. Correctness:** The function's correctness is high, provided the `postal_code_formats` dictionary is accurate and complete for the intended postal codes.  The use of compiled regular expressions ensures that the pattern matching is efficient.  However, the accuracy is entirely dependent on the data in the `postal_code_formats` dictionary.  Inaccuracies or omissions in this dictionary will directly impact the correctness of the function's output.\n\n**2. Efficiency:** The use of compiled regular expressions (`re.compile`) is a significant improvement. This avoids recompiling the regular expressions for each postal code, leading to better performance, especially for large datasets. The use of a lambda function within `apply` is generally more efficient than defining a separate function, minimizing function call overhead.  While `apply` is not as efficient as fully vectorized pandas operations, the performance gain from compiled regexes likely outweighs this for most practical scenarios.  For extremely large datasets, further optimization might be needed (e.g., using Numba for JIT compilation of the lambda function).\n\n**3. Edge Case Handling:** The function now handles missing values (`fillna('')`) and explicitly checks for the correct data type, raising a `TypeError` for non-string columns.  It also validates the regex patterns in the lookup table, raising a `ValueError` if they are invalid.  However, it still doesn't explicitly handle extremely long strings or postal codes embedded within larger strings.  While the regexes themselves might fail in these cases, explicit checks could provide more informative error messages.\n\n**4. Readability & Maintainability:** The code is well-structured and highly readable. The use of a lookup table and compiled regexes significantly improves maintainability. The docstring is clear and informative, and the comments are helpful.\n\n**5. Scalability:** The function is highly scalable. The use of compiled regexes and the efficient `apply` method (with a lambda) make it suitable for large datasets. The lookup table approach allows easy expansion to support more postal code formats without altering the core logic.\n\n**6. Security & Robustness:** The function is secure and robust.  There are no obvious security vulnerabilities. The explicit type checking and regex pattern validation contribute significantly to its robustness.\n\n**7. Generalizability:** The generalizability is excellent. Adding support for new postal code formats only requires updating the `postal_code_formats` dictionary.  The core logic remains unchanged.\n\n**8. Data Handling & Type Safety:** The function performs excellent data type validation, raising a `TypeError` if the input column isn't a string type.\n\n**9. Error Handling:** Error handling is robust.  It raises a `TypeError` for incorrect input types and a `ValueError` for invalid regex patterns in the lookup table.  More comprehensive error handling could include checks for extremely long strings or postal codes embedded within other text.\n\n**10. Output Consistency:** The output is consistently a pandas Series of boolean values.\n\n\n**Domain-Specific Considerations:**\n\n* **Numerical Data:**  Correctly handles numerical data *only* if it's been converted to strings (which is a reasonable assumption for postal codes).\n* **Categorical & Text Data:** Handles categorical and text data effectively.\n* **Date & Time Data:** Not applicable.\n* **Geographical Data:** Effectively handles postal codes, a specific aspect of geographical data.\n\n\n**Final Score:**\n\n```json\n{\"score\": 9}\n```\n\nThis version of the function is well-designed, efficient, robust, and highly generalizable.  The use of compiled regexes and a lookup table significantly enhances performance and maintainability.  The only minor areas for improvement would be to add more explicit error handling for edge cases like extremely long strings and postal codes embedded within other text and potentially exploring even more optimized solutions (like Numba) for extremely large datasets where the marginal performance gain might be significant.",

      "optimize_prompt": "\n**Task:** Improve the following function based on the provided feedback.  \n\n#### **Feedback:**  \n## Evaluation of `is_pincode` Function\n\nHere's a detailed evaluation of the revised `is_pincode` function:\n\n**1. Correctness:** The function's correctness is significantly improved. The use of a lookup table makes it much more adaptable to different postal code formats. However, the correctness still depends entirely on the completeness of the `postal_code_formats` dictionary.  If a country's format is missing or incorrect, the function will produce inaccurate results.  It's crucial to maintain and expand this dictionary accurately.\n\n**2. Efficiency:** While the use of `apply` with a custom function is generally less efficient than purely vectorized operations, the performance impact is likely to be minor for most datasets unless you are dealing with truly massive DataFrames. The lookup table approach improves maintainability, which often outweighs minor efficiency losses.  For extremely large datasets, consider exploring alternative approaches like using a compiled regex or a more optimized lookup mechanism (e.g., a Pandas `Categorical` for faster lookups).\n\n**3. Edge Case Handling:** The function now explicitly checks for the correct data type (string) and raises a `TypeError` if it's not suitable. It handles missing values (`fillna('')`).  However, it still doesn't explicitly handle extremely long strings (though the regex itself will likely fail on extremely long inputs) or postal codes embedded within other text.\n\n**4. Readability & Maintainability:** The code is well-structured and readable. The use of a lookup table significantly improves maintainability compared to a large, complex regex. The docstring is clear and informative.  The comments are helpful.\n\n**5. Scalability:**  The function is reasonably scalable.  The use of the `apply` function might become a bottleneck for extremely large datasets, but for most practical scenarios, it should perform adequately.  The lookup table approach makes it easy to add new postal code formats without modifying the core logic.\n\n**6. Security & Robustness:**  The function is secure and robust. There are no obvious security vulnerabilities. The explicit type check adds to its robustness.\n\n**7. Generalizability:** The generalizability is significantly improved.  Adding new postal code formats requires only updating the `postal_code_formats` dictionary; the core validation logic remains unchanged.\n\n**8. Data Handling & Type Safety:** The function now explicitly checks the data type and raises a `TypeError` if it's inappropriate.  This is a significant improvement in data handling and type safety.\n\n**9. Error Handling:** The error handling is improved by including the `TypeError` for incorrect data types.  More robust error handling could include checks for the validity of regex patterns in the lookup table itself.\n\n**10. Output Consistency:** The output consistently returns a pandas Series of boolean values.\n\n\n**Domain-Specific Considerations:**\n\n* **Numerical Data:** The function explicitly rejects non-string columns; this is correct because postal codes often contain alphabetic characters.\n* **Categorical & Text Data:** The function works well for categorical and text data.\n* **Date & Time Data:** Not applicable.\n* **Geographical Data:** The function handles a specific aspect of geographical data (postal codes) effectively.\n\n\n**Final Score:**\n\n```json\n{\"score\": 8}\n```\n\nThe function is well-implemented, highly readable, and much more maintainable and generalizable than the previous versions.  The use of a lookup table is a significant improvement.  While the `apply` function might introduce a slight performance penalty for extremely large datasets, the overall design and robustness justify a score of 8. Minor improvements could include more sophisticated error handling and potentially exploring alternative, more performant lookup mechanisms for massive datasets.  \n\n#### **Function:**  \n```python  \n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport re\n\ndef is_pincode(df: pd.DataFrame, column_name: str) -> pd.Series:\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if values in a specified DataFrame column are valid postal/ZIP codes.

      "evaluation_response": "## Evaluation of `is_address_line` Function (Improved Version)\n\n**1. Correctness:** The function's correctness is improved due to the enhanced regular expression.  It's still reliant on the regex, so edge cases might exist where addresses are incorrectly classified (false positives or negatives).  The improved regex handles a wider range of address formats than the previous version.\n\n**2. Efficiency:** The use of `str.match` is a significant improvement. This vectorized operation is substantially more efficient than the previous `apply` method, leading to better performance, especially with large DataFrames.  The time complexity is now largely determined by the regex matching speed, which is generally efficient for reasonably sized strings. Space complexity remains low.\n\n**3. Edge Case Handling:**  The function handles missing data (`NaN`) effectively with `na=False` in `str.match`. Empty strings are also correctly handled by the regex.  However, extremely long addresses or addresses with unusual characters could still pose challenges. The function now also correctly handles cases where the input column is not a string type.\n\n**4. Readability & Maintainability:** The code is well-structured and readable. The comments clearly explain the purpose of each section. The regular expression, while more complex, is still relatively understandable.  Breaking down the regex into smaller, named components could further improve maintainability if it grows significantly more intricate.\n\n**5. Scalability:** The use of vectorized operations makes the function highly scalable.  It can efficiently process large datasets without significant performance degradation compared to the original version.\n\n**6. Security & Robustness:** No security vulnerabilities are present. The input handling is safe and robust.\n\n**7. Generalizability:** The function is more generalizable than the previous version due to the improved regex. However, the regex might still need adjustments for very specific address formats in different regions or countries.\n\n**8. Data Handling & Type Safety:** The function explicitly checks the data type of the input column, ensuring that it operates only on string-like data. This significantly improves type safety and prevents unexpected errors.\n\n**9. Error Handling:** The function checks for the existence of the column, and handles non-string columns gracefully.  Adding a `try-except` block around the `str.match` to catch potential regex errors would enhance robustness further, though the likelihood of such errors is relatively low with a well-formed regex.\n\n**10. Output Consistency:** The function consistently returns a Pandas Series of boolean values, maintaining consistent output structure and type.\n\n\n**Domain-Specific Considerations:**\n\n* **Numerical Data:** The function correctly handles numerical columns by returning an empty Series. This is a desirable behavior as the function is not intended for numerical data.\n\n* **Categorical & Text Data:**  The function is designed for and works correctly with categorical and text data (string columns).\n\n* **Date & Time Data:** The function will not correctly classify date/time columns; it will return an empty Series, which is appropriate given its purpose.\n\n* **Geographical Data:**  The function does not directly handle geographical data.  It only assesses the string format, not geographical validity.\n\n\n**Final Score:**\n\nThe improved function addresses many of the previous shortcomings. The use of vectorized operations greatly enhances efficiency and scalability.  The improved regular expression and type checking add to its robustness and correctness.  While minor enhancements are still possible (e.g., more robust error handling), the overall implementation is strong.\n\n```json\n{\"score\": 9}\n```",

      "optimize_prompt": "\n**Task:** Improve the following function based on the provided feedback.  \n\n#### **Feedback:**  \n## Evaluation of `is_address_line` Function\n\n**1. Correctness:** The function generally works correctly for identifying strings that resemble address lines based on the regular expression. However, the regular expression is relatively simplistic and might produce false positives or negatives depending on the variations in address formats.  It correctly handles empty strings and `NaN` values.\n\n**2. Efficiency:** The use of Pandas' `apply` method with a custom function is not the most efficient approach for large datasets. Vectorized operations using Pandas' built-in string functions would be significantly faster. The regular expression itself is reasonably efficient, but could be refined for optimal performance.\n\n**3. Edge Case Handling:** The function adequately handles `NaN` values and empty strings. It also strips leading/trailing whitespace. However, it doesn't explicitly handle other potential edge cases like unusually long addresses or addresses with non-standard characters.\n\n**4. Readability & Maintainability:** The code is well-structured and reasonably readable. The use of a separate `check_address` function improves organization. Comments are helpful in explaining the logic.  The regular expression could be improved with more descriptive comments or broken down into smaller, more manageable expressions if it becomes more complex.\n\n**5. Scalability:**  Due to the use of `apply`, the function's scalability is limited for very large datasets.  Vectorized operations would be essential for better scalability.\n\n**6. Security & Robustness:**  There are no apparent security vulnerabilities. The function handles input safely by converting values to strings and checking for emptiness.\n\n**7. Generalizability:** The function is relatively generalizable to different datasets containing address-like strings. However, the regular expression might need adjustments depending on the specific address format conventions in the dataset.\n\n**8. Data Handling & Type Safety:** The function handles data type conversions appropriately by converting values to strings.  It explicitly checks for `NaN` values.\n\n**9. Error Handling:**  The function includes error handling by checking if the column exists in the DataFrame.  However, more robust error handling (e.g., try-except blocks for potential regex errors) could be added for enhanced robustness.\n\n**10. Output Consistency:** The function consistently returns a Pandas Series of boolean values, which is as expected.\n\n\n**Domain-Specific Considerations:**\n\n* **Numerical Data:** The function is *not* designed for numerical data.  It explicitly checks for and handles strings. Applying it to a numerical column would return all `False` values (except for potential numerical strings).\n\n* **Categorical & Text Data:** The function is designed for categorical and text data, specifically strings that might represent addresses.\n\n* **Date & Time Data:** The function is *not* designed for date and time data. Applying it to a date/time column would likely result in incorrect classifications.\n\n* **Geographical Data:** The function does *not* directly handle geographical data. While an address might contain geographical information, the function only assesses the string's format, not its geographical validity.\n\n\n**Final Score:**\n\nBased on the evaluation, the function demonstrates good readability and handles some edge cases, but its efficiency and scalability are limitations.  The lack of explicit handling for various data types beyond strings also reduces its versatility.\n\n```json\n{\"score\": 7}\n```  \n\n#### **Function:**  \n```python  \n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport re\n\ndef is_address_line(df: pd.DataFrame, column_name: str) -> pd.Series:\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines if a given column in a Pandas DataFrame represents an address line.\n\n    Args:\n        df: The input Pandas DataFrame.\n        column_name: The name of the column to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        A Pandas Series of boolean values indicating whether each value in the \n        specified column represents an address line.

Correctness:** The function's correctness still hinges on the regular expression. While the `address_pattern` has been improved, it remains imperfect.  Complex or unusual address formats might still lead to false positives or false negatives. The use of `str.fullmatch` is a good choice as it requires the entire string to match the pattern, reducing the chances of partial matches being incorrectly classified as addresses.  However, a dedicated address parsing library would provide significantly higher accuracy.\n\n**2. Efficiency:** The function is highly efficient due to its use of pandas' vectorized `str.fullmatch` method. The time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of rows, making it suitable for large datasets. Space complexity is minimal.\n\n**3. Edge Case Handling:** The function effectively handles edge cases:\n    * **Missing Column:** It correctly returns an empty Series if the specified column doesn't exist.\n    * **Empty Column:** It handles empty columns (all `NaN` values) correctly.\n    * **Data Types:** It converts the column to strings (`astype(str)`), gracefully handling various input data types.\n    * **Non-Matches:** `str.fullmatch` returns `NaN` for non-matching strings, which are efficiently handled by `.fillna(False)`.\n\n**4. Readability & Maintainability:** The code is well-structured, readable, and maintainable.  The comments are clear and informative, and variable names are descriptive.\n\n**5. Scalability:**  The vectorized approach ensures excellent scalability.  The function can efficiently handle very large datasets without performance degradation.\n\n**6. Security & Robustness:** The function is secure and robust. There are no apparent security vulnerabilities. It effectively handles potential errors related to data types and regex matching.\n\n**7. Generalizability:** The function is reasonably generalizable. The regex can be modified to adapt to slightly different address formats. However, for significantly different address structures, a more flexible approach (e.g., using a library) would be more appropriate.\n\n**8. Data Handling & Type Safety:**  The function handles various data types safely by converting the column to strings. This prevents errors due to type mismatches.\n\n**9. Error Handling:**  Implicit error handling through `.fillna(False)` is sufficient for this specific task.  Explicit `try-except` blocks are not necessary in this case.\n\n**10. Output Consistency:** The function consistently returns a pandas Series of boolean values, ensuring consistent output format and type.\n\n\n**Domain-Specific Considerations:**\n\n* **Numerical Data:** Not suitable for numerical data; numerical columns are converted to strings, resulting in mostly `False` outputs.\n* **Categorical & Text Data:**  Suitable for text data containing address-like strings. Categorical columns are handled correctly if they contain string representations of addresses.\n* **Date & Time Data:** Not suitable for date and time data; they are treated as strings, potentially leading to misinterpretations.\n* **Geographical Data:** Does not directly handle geographical data; it only checks for address-like patterns.\n\n\n**Final Score:**\n\n{\"score\": 9}\n\nThis final version is a significant improvement.  The efficiency and scalability are excellent. The regex is more robust, and the handling of edge cases is thorough. The only limitation is the inherent imprecision of using a regular expression for address detection.  For significantly higher accuracy, especially with diverse and complex address data, a dedicated address parsing library is strongly recommended.  However, for many common use cases, this function provides a very good balance of efficiency and accuracy.",

      "optimize_prompt": "\n**Task:** Improve the following function based on the provided feedback.  \n\n#### **Feedback:**  \n## Evaluation of `is_address_line` Function (Further Improved Version)\n\nHere's a detailed evaluation of the provided Python function:\n\n**1. Correctness:** The function's correctness depends heavily on the regular expression. The provided regex (`address_pattern`) is more robust than previous versions, handling a wider range of address formats. However, it's still not perfect and might produce false positives (incorrectly identifying non-addresses) or false negatives (missing valid addresses) depending on the data's variability and complexity.  A dedicated address parsing library would offer significantly higher accuracy.\n\n**2. Efficiency:** The function leverages pandas' vectorized string operations (`str.match`), making it highly efficient for large datasets. The time complexity is approximately O(n), where n is the number of rows in the DataFrame.  Space complexity is low because it operates directly on the DataFrame column without creating large intermediate data structures.\n\n**3. Edge Case Handling:** The function effectively handles missing data (NaN values) by using `.fillna(False)`. The `astype(str)` conversion ensures that various data types are handled gracefully.  The implicit error handling within `str.match` (returning NaN for non-matches) is efficiently addressed by `fillna(False)`.\n\n**4. Readability & Maintainability:** The code is well-structured, readable, and maintainable.  The comments clearly explain the purpose and logic. Variable names are descriptive.\n\n**5. Scalability:** The vectorized approach makes the function highly scalable. It can process large datasets efficiently without performance degradation.\n\n**6. Security & Robustness:** The function is secure and robust. There are no apparent security vulnerabilities.  It handles potential errors related to data types and regex matching effectively.\n\n**7. Generalizability:** The function is reasonably generalizable.  The regex can be modified to accommodate slightly different address formats, but significant changes might require a more flexible solution (like using a dedicated library).\n\n**8. Data Handling & Type Safety:** The function handles various data types safely by converting the input column to strings. This prevents errors due to type mismatches.\n\n**9. Error Handling:** Although explicit `try-except` blocks are absent, the implicit error handling (`.fillna(False)`) adequately addresses potential issues arising from the regex matching process.  This approach is efficient and suitable for this specific use case.\n\n\n**10. Output Consistency:** The function consistently returns a pandas Series of boolean values, ensuring consistent output format and type.\n\n\n**Domain-Specific Considerations:**\n\n* **Numerical Data:**  The function is not designed for numerical data. Numerical columns will be converted to strings, and the regex will likely not find matches, resulting in mostly `False` values.\n* **Categorical & Text Data:** The function is suitable for text data, particularly when the text data contains address-like strings. Categorical columns are handled if they contain string representations of addresses.\n* **Date & Time Data:** The function is not appropriate for date and time data.  It will treat them as strings, potentially leading to misinterpretations.\n* **Geographical Data:** The function does not directly handle geographical data. It only checks for the presence of an address-like pattern.\n\n\n**Final Score:**\n\n{\"score\": 8}\n\nThe function is well-implemented, efficient, and scalable.  The improvements to the regex and the use of vectorized operations are significant. However, the reliance on a regular expression, even a more robust one, still limits the accuracy and makes it less reliable than a dedicated address parsing library for complex or diverse address data.

      "evaluation_response": "## Evaluation of `is_address_line` Function (Improved Version)\n\nThis revised version shows significant improvements over the original.\n\n**1. Correctness:** The function's correctness is improved by the enhanced regular expression.  However, the regex still isn't perfect; it will incorrectly classify some non-address strings as addresses and might miss some valid addresses depending on their formatting.  The `na=False` argument in `str.match` correctly handles missing values.\n\n**2. Efficiency:** The use of pandas' vectorized `str.match` is a significant improvement. This avoids the slower `apply` method, resulting in much better performance, especially on large datasets. Time complexity is now closer to O(m*n) where n is the number of rows and m is the length of the regex. Space complexity remains O(n) to store the boolean Series.\n\n**3. Edge Case Handling:** The function effectively handles missing data (`na=False` in `str.match`) and converts all values to strings (`astype(str)`).  It also correctly handles empty columns.  However, extremely long strings could still potentially impact performance (though less so than with `apply`).  The regex remains the primary limitation in edge-case handling.\n\n\n**4. Readability & Maintainability:** The code is concise, well-structured, and easy to understand. The comments are helpful.  The use of vectorized operations enhances readability.\n\n**5. Scalability:** The vectorized approach makes the function much more scalable compared to the original. It should handle large datasets efficiently.\n\n**6. Security & Robustness:** No security vulnerabilities are apparent. Input handling is safe and robust.\n\n**7. Generalizability:**  The function is reasonably generalizable.  Modifying the `address_pattern` regex allows adaptation to different address formats.  However, creating a truly general and accurate regex for all possible address formats worldwide is a very challenging task.\n\n**8. Data Handling & Type Safety:** The `astype(str)` conversion handles various data types effectively.  The function's type hints are clear and improve type safety.\n\n**9. Error Handling:** The initial check for column existence and emptiness is sufficient error handling for the current logic.  More sophisticated error handling might be needed if the regex itself could throw exceptions (unlikely but possible in extreme cases).\n\n**10. Output Consistency:** The function consistently returns a pandas Series of boolean values with the correct length.\n\n\n**Domain-Specific Considerations:**\n\n* **Numerical Data:** Numerical data is correctly handled; it's converted to strings, and if it doesn't match the regex, it's marked as False.\n* **Categorical & Text Data:** The function works well for categorical and text data, provided the address-like patterns are present.\n* **Date & Time Data:** Date and time data are treated as strings.  If a date/time string happens to match the regex, it will be classified as an address, which is not ideal.\n* **Geographical Data:** The function does not directly handle geographical data.\n\n\n**Final Score:**\n\nThe improved version is significantly better than the original.  The use of vectorized operations greatly enhances efficiency and scalability. While the regex could still be improved for greater accuracy, the overall implementation is robust and well-structured.\n\n```json\n{\"score\": 9}\n```",

      "optimize_prompt": "\n**Task:** Improve the following function based on the provided feedback.  \n\n#### **Feedback:**  \n## Evaluation of `is_address_line` Function\n\nThe `is_address_line` function demonstrates a reasonable approach to identifying address lines within a DataFrame column, but has room for improvement in several areas.\n\n**1. Correctness:** The function's correctness depends heavily on the accuracy of the regular expression (`address_pattern`). While it captures common address formats, it's not exhaustive.  Many valid addresses won't match (e.g., those with unusual street names, PO Boxes, or apartment numbers formatted differently).  The function correctly identifies that non-string values and missing values are not address lines.\n\n**2. Efficiency:** The use of `apply` with a custom function can be less efficient than vectorized operations for large DataFrames.  Pandas' built-in string functions or a more optimized regex approach could improve performance.  Time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of rows, due to the row-wise application. Space complexity is O(n) as well, to store the boolean Series.\n\n**3. Edge Case Handling:** The function handles missing data (`pd.isna`) and numeric data types well.  However,  it could benefit from more robust handling of unusual string formats or extremely long strings that might cause unexpected behavior. The regex itself is a limitation here, as it doesn't account for the full range of address formats.\n\n**4. Readability & Maintainability:** The code is well-structured and reasonably commented. Variable names are descriptive. The separation of the address checking logic into a separate function (`check_address`) enhances readability.\n\n**5. Scalability:** As mentioned in efficiency, the use of `apply` limits scalability for very large datasets. Vectorization would significantly improve scalability.\n\n**6. Security & Robustness:** There are no apparent security vulnerabilities. The function handles inputs safely and avoids potential injection attacks.\n\n**7. Generalizability:** The function is relatively generalizable.  Changing the regular expression could adapt it to different address formats or conventions. However, it's heavily reliant on the regex, which might need significant changes for international addresses.\n\n**8. Data Handling & Type Safety:** The function correctly handles various data types (strings, numbers, missing values).  Type checking is implicit through the `isinstance` checks.  Explicit type hints improve clarity.\n\n**9. Error Handling:**  The function includes error handling for the case where the specified column doesn't exist in the DataFrame.  No explicit `try-except` blocks are needed given the current logic, but adding them for potential future regex errors might be prudent.\n\n**10. Output Consistency:** The function consistently returns a pandas Series of boolean values, even when the input column is empty or doesn't exist.\n\n\n**Domain-Specific Considerations:**\n\n* **Numerical Data:** The function correctly handles numerical data by returning `False`.\n* **Categorical & Text Data:** The function is designed for text data (address lines).  Categorical columns will be handled based on whether their values match the regex.\n* **Date & Time Data:** The function doesn't explicitly handle date and time data.  Values that happen to match the regex will be considered address lines, while others will be correctly identified as not address lines.\n* **Geographical Data:**  The function does not directly handle or extract geographical information.  It only attempts to identify lines that *resemble* addresses.\n\n\n**Final Score:**\n\nConsidering the above evaluation, the function is functional but has areas for improvement, particularly regarding efficiency and the limitations of the regular expression.  The lack of explicit handling of dates, times, and geographical data further reduces its score.\n\n```json\n{\"score\": 7}\n```  \n\n#### **Function:**  \n```python  \n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport re\n\ndef is_address_line(df: pd.DataFrame, column_name: str) -> pd.Series:\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines if a given column in a DataFrame represents an address line.\n\n    Args:\n        df: The input DataFrame.\n        column_name: The name of the column to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        A pandas Series of booleans indicating whether each value in the \n        specified column represents an address line.

      "evaluation_response": "## Evaluation of `find_mean` function\n\n**1. Correctness:** The function correctly calculates the mean of a numeric column in a Pandas DataFrame. It handles cases where the column is empty or contains non-numeric values by returning `np.nan`.  The `pd.to_numeric(errors='coerce')` method is effectively used to convert to numeric and handle non-numeric entries gracefully.\n\n**2. Efficiency:** The function is efficient. It leverages Pandas' vectorized operations (`pd.to_numeric`, `.mean()`) which are significantly faster than iterating through the column.  Time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of rows, which is optimal for this task. Space complexity is O(1) as it doesn't create large intermediate data structures.\n\n**3. Edge Case Handling:** The function excels in edge case handling. It explicitly checks for:\n    *   Empty DataFrame: Implicitly handled by pandas.\n    *   Empty Column:  `numeric_column.isnull().all()` correctly identifies and handles this.\n    *   Non-numeric data: `pd.to_numeric(errors='coerce')` converts non-numeric values to NaN, preventing errors.\n    *   Missing column: A `KeyError` is raised, providing informative feedback.\n    *   Incorrect input type: A `TypeError` is raised if the input `df` isn't a Pandas DataFrame.\n\n**4. Readability & Maintainability:** The code is well-structured and easy to understand. Variable names are descriptive (`numeric_column`). Docstrings clearly explain the function's purpose, arguments, return value, and exceptions.  Comments are concise and helpful.\n\n**5. Scalability:** The function is highly scalable due to the use of Pandas' vectorized operations.  It can efficiently handle large datasets without significant performance degradation.\n\n**6. Security & Robustness:** The function is secure and robust. It doesn't have any obvious security vulnerabilities like injection attacks. Input validation is performed to prevent unexpected errors.\n\n**7. Generalizability:** The function is highly generalizable. It can be easily applied to different datasets with numeric columns.  No modifications are needed beyond providing the DataFrame and column name.\n\n**8. Data Handling & Type Safety:** The function effectively handles data types.  `pd.to_numeric` performs type conversion, and error handling ensures that non-numeric values are appropriately handled.\n\n**9. Error Handling:**  The function uses appropriate error handling (`try-except` is not strictly necessary given the explicit checks and pandas' error handling capabilities) with clear error messages, improving robustness.\n\n**10. Output Consistency:** The function consistently returns a single `float` value (or `np.nan`) representing the mean, ensuring consistent output type.\n\n\n**Domain-Specific Considerations:**\n\n* **Numerical Data:** The function is specifically designed for numerical data and handles it very well.\n\n* **Categorical & Text Data:** The function is *not* suitable for categorical or text data.  Attempting to calculate the mean of such data would lead to meaningless results or errors.  The function correctly handles this by converting non-numeric to NaN.\n\n* **Date & Time Data:** The function is *not* directly suitable for date and time data.  While `pd.to_numeric` might attempt conversion (depending on the date/time format), the resulting mean would likely not be meaningful.  A different function would be needed for meaningful analysis of date/time data.\n\n* **Geographical Data:** Similar to date/time,  the function is not suitable for geographical data.  Directly calculating the mean of latitude/longitude might produce a technically correct but geographically meaningless result.  Specialized functions would be required for analysis of geographical data.\n\n\n**Final Score:**\n\n```json\n{\"score\": 9}\n```",
